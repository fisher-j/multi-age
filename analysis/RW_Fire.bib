  abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000\textendash 2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({$>$}1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984\textendash 2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

  abstract = {A cellular automata fire model represents `elements' of fire by autonomous agents. A few simple algebraic expressions substituted for complex physical and meteorological processes and solved iteratively yield simulations for `super-diffusive' fire spread and coupled surface-layer (2-m) fire\textendash atmosphere processes. Pressure anomalies, which are integrals of the thermal properties of the overlying heated plume, drive the surface winds around and through the fire. Five simulations with differing fuel and wind conditions were compared with fire and meteorological data from an experimental grassfire (FireFlux). The fire model accurately simulated bulk patterns of measured time-series of 2-m winds at two towers and observed fire behaviour (spread rate, flaming depth and heat released). Fidelity to spatial windfields in the vicinity of the fire was similar to results from full-physics fire models for other grassfires. Accurate predictions of fire spread depend critically on accurate wind speeds and directions at the location of the fire. Simulated fire\textendash atmosphere coupling using FireFlux data increased wind speeds across the fire line by up to a factor of three. With its computational speed relative to full-physics models, the fire model can inform full-physics modellers regarding problems of interest. Although the fire model is tested for homogeneous fuels on flat terrain, the model is designed for simulating complex distributions of fire within heterogeneous distributions of fuels over complex landscapes.},

  abstract = {Smoke plume rise is critically dependent on plume updraft structure. Smoke plumes from landscape burns (forest and agricultural burns) are typically structured into ``sub-plumes'' or multiple-core updrafts with the number of updraft cores depending on characteristics of the landscape, fire, fuels, and weather. The number of updraft cores determines the efficiency of vertical transport of heat and particulate matter and therefore plume rise. Daysmoke, an empirical-stochastic plume rise model designed for simulating wildland fire plumes, requires updraft core number as an input. In this study, updraft core number was gained via a cellular automata fire model applied to an aerial ignition prescribed burn conducted at Eglin AFB on 6 February 2011. Typically four updraft cores were simulated in agreement with a photo-image of the plume showing three/four distinct sub-plumes. Other Daysmoke input variables were calculated including maximum initial updraft core diameter, updraft core vertical velocity, and relative emissions production. Daysmoke simulated a vertical tower that mushroomed 1,000 m above the mixing height. Plume rise was validated by ceilometer. Simulations with two temperature profiles found 89\textendash 93 percent of the PM2.5 released during the flaming phase was transported into the free atmosphere above the mixing layer. The minimal ground-level smoke concentrations were verified by a small network of particulate samplers. Implications of these results for inclusion of wildland fire smoke in air quality models are discussed.},

We briefly review the development and limitations of current conifer crown fuel models in this region as they impact the potential utility of fire behavior simulations. We then identify and evaluate conifer crown modeling efforts and techniques that have been advanced outside the fire and fuels domain, including models developed for bio-energy and carbon inventory, wood quality determination, and empirical and process-based growth and yield projections. Whereas the latter models often focus on crown parameters distinct from those traditionally described in fuels studies, we contend that advances in conifer crown fuel modeling can be made by recognizing and extending the results of these parallel lines of research. Such advances are needed to adequately parameterize crown fuels if we are to reap advantages from next-generation fire behavior models and, by extension, to improve our understanding of fuels management and treatment strategies. At the same time, more information must be derived from long-term fuels treatment and silvicultural trials to improve our understanding of how conifer crowns respond to treatments.},

  abstract = {Successful fire exclusion in the 20th century has created severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire, Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire losses in Western forests.},

  abstract = {Fire spread in wildland fuels is modeled as the steady, longitudinal propagation of an isothermal surface at ignition temperature by the process of radiation transport through a uniform layer of randomly-distributed, thermally-thin, radiometrically-black fuel particles. The ignition isotherm is assumed to be a perfect diffuse radiator, as is the idealized planar flame sheet that stands above the fuel bed. An algorithm is described that finds the temperature field everywhere in the fuel bed, the shape of the ignition isotherm, and the fire spread rate. The fire spread rate, multiplied by the heat required to ignite a unit volume of the fuel bed, divided by the hemispherical power flux density from the ignition isotherm, is an eigenvalue of this problem. The approximation of unit emissivity for fuel particles is shown to be robust in the one-dimensional limiting case of an infinitely-deep fuel bed. This limiting case is solved by a different algorithm that takes advantage of the axial symmetry of the radiation intensity field and allows explicit use of the scattering function for randomly-oriented, convex, radiometrically gray, diffuse scattering particles. It is shown that the temperature field is insensitive to particle emissivity for emissivity greater than 0.7 in this limit.},

The nature and characteristics of free-burning wildland fires pose challenges to acquiring the kind of quality data necessary for adequate fire behaviour model evaluation. As a result, in some circles it has led to a research culture that tends to avoid evaluating model performance. Operational fire modelling systems commonly used in western North America have been shown to exhibit an underprediction bias when employed to determine the threshold conditions necessary for the onset of crowning and the associated spread rate of active crown fires in conifer forest stands. This pronouncement was made a few years ago after at least a decade of model misapplication in fire and fuel management simulation modelling stemming from a lack of model evaluation. There are signs that the same situation may be repeated with developing physics-based models that simulate potential wildland fire behaviour; these models have as yet undergone limited testing against observations garnered from planned and/or accidental wildland fires. We propose a broad co-operative project encompassing modellers and experimentalists is needed to define and acquire the benchmark fire behaviour data required for model calibration and evaluation.},

More specifically, the following topical areas are critically examined based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent literature: (i) estimating fireline intensity from flame length; (ii) substituting flame length for fireline intensity in Van Wagner's crown fire initiation model; (iii) the validity of linkages between the Rothermel surface fire behaviour and Van Wagner's crown scorch height models; (iv) estimating flame height from post-fire observations of stem-bark char height; and (v) estimating fireline intensity from post-fire observations of crown scorch height.

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of fuels is essential for wildland fire simulations as well as decision-making related to land management. Numerous research efforts have leveraged remote sensing and machine learning for classifying land cover and mapping forest vegetation species. In most cases that focused on surface fuel mapping, the spatial scale of interest was smaller than a few hundred square kilometers; thus, many small-scale site-specific models had to be created to cover the landscape at the national scale. The present work aims to develop a large-scale surface fuel identification model using a custom deep learning framework that can ingest multimodal data. Specifically, we use deep learning to extract information from multispectral signatures, high-resolution imagery, and biophysical climate and terrain data in a way that facilitates their end-to-end training on labeled data. A multi-layer neural network is used with spectral and biophysical data, and a convolutional neural network backbone is used to extract the visual features from high-resolution imagery. A Monte Carlo dropout mechanism was also devised to create a stochastic ensemble of models that can capture classification uncertainties while boosting the prediction performance. To train the system as a proof-of-concept, fuel pseudo-labels were created by a random geospatial sampling of existing fuel maps across California. Application results on independent test sets showed promising fuel identification performance with an overall accuracy ranging from 55\% to 75\%, depending on the level of granularity of the included fuel types. As expected, including the rare\textemdash and possibly less consequential\textemdash fuel types reduced the accuracy. On the other hand, the addition of high-resolution imagery improved classification performance at all levels.},

  abstract = {Fire researchers and resource managers are dependent upon accurate, spatially-explicit forest structure information to support the application of forest fire behavior models. In particular, reliable estimates of several critical forest canopy structure metrics, including canopy bulk density, canopy height, canopy fuel weight, and canopy base height, are required to accurately map the spatial distribution of canopy fuels and model fire behavior over the landscape. The use of airborne laser scanning (LIDAR), a high-resolution active remote sensing technology, provides for accurate and efficient measurement of three-dimensional forest structure over extensive areas. In this study, regression analysis was used to develop predictive models relating a variety of LIDAR-based metrics to the canopy fuel parameters estimated from inventory data collected at plots established within stands of varying condition within Capitol State Forest, in western Washington State. Strong relationships between LIDAR-derived metrics and field-based fuel estimates were found for all parameters [sqrt(crown fuel weight): R2=0.86; ln(crown bulk density): R2=0.84; canopy base height: R2=0.77; canopy height: R2=0.98]. A cross-validation procedure was used to assess the reliability of these models. LIDAR-based fuel prediction models can be used to develop maps of critical canopy fuel parameters over forest areas in the Pacific Northwest.},

BehavePlus is based on mathematical models for fire behaviour, fire effects and fire environment. It is a point system for which conditions are constant for each calculation, but is designed to encourage examination of the effect of a range of conditions through tables and graphs. BehavePlus is successor to BEHAVE, which was developed in 1977 and became available for field application in 1984. It was updated to BehavePlus in 2002. Updates through version 5 have added features and modelling capabilities. It is becoming increasingly difficult to expand the system. A redesign will address the need for consolidation with other systems and make it easier to incorporate new research results. This paper describes the development history and application of BehavePlus. The design, features and modelling foundation of the current system are described.

It is generally used with other models including fireline intensity and flame length. Fuel models are often used to define fuel input parameters. Dynamic fuel models use equations for live fuel curing. Models have been developed for the effect of cross-slope wind and for fire spread in directions other than head fire. Equations for the Rothermel model and associated models are presented for easy reference. The influence of input variables on results is examined. While the spread model is used in the U.S. National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS), there are significant differences. The NFDRS equations and fuel models are given. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for those interested in the foundation of wildland fire modeling. System developers will benefit from equations from various sources being in one document. Developers of custom fuel models will find information on the impact of fuel parameters on rate of spread calculations.},

  abstract = {The distribution of fuels is recognised as a key driver of wildland fire behaviour. However, our understanding of how fuel density heterogeneity affects fire behaviour is limited because of the challenges associated with experiments that isolate fuel heterogeneity from other factors. Advances in fire behaviour modelling and computational resources provide a means to explore fire behaviour responses to fuel heterogeneity. Using an ensemble approach to simulate fire behaviour in a coupled fire\textendash atmosphere model, we systematically tested how fuel density fidelity and heterogeneity shape effective wind characteristics that ultimately affect fire behaviour. Results showed that with increased fuel density fidelity and heterogeneity, fire spread and area burned decreased owing to a combination of fuel discontinuities and increased fine-scale turbulent wind structures that blocked forward fire spread. However, at large characteristic length scales of spatial fuel density, the fire spread and area burned increased because local fuel discontinuity decreased, and wind entrainment into the forest canopy maintained near-surface wind speeds that drove forward fire spread. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating high-resolution fuel fidelity and heterogeneity information to capture effective wind conditions that improve fire behaviour forecasts.},

  abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.},

This review will present, in an accessible manner, the next evolution in wildfire models.

These wildfire models are then coupled to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or mesoscale weather model. In other words, wildfire models become weather and climate models with add-in fuel and terrain models. These coupled models can use existing fire and weather physics or developed noncoupled models with a coupling mechanism. These models are tailored for specific spatial and temporal scales.},

Uncovering the exact physiological mechanisms and relating specific injuries to whole-plant and ecosystem functioning is the focus of intense current research. Recent studies have made critical steps forward in our understanding of tree physiological processes after fires, and have suggested mechanisms by which fire injuries may interact with disturbances such as drought, insects and pathogens. We outline a conceptual framework that unifies the involved processes, their interconnections, and possible feedbacks, and contextualizes these responses with existing hypotheses for disturbance effects on plants and ecosystems. By focusing on carbon and water as currencies of plant functioning, we demonstrate fire-induced cambium/phloem necrosis and xylem damage to be main disturbance effects. The resulting carbon starvation and hydraulic dysfunction are linked with drought and insect impacts. Evaluating the precise process relationships will be crucial for fully understanding how fires can affect tree functionality, and will help improve fire risk assessment and mortality model predictions. Especially considering future climate-driven increases in fire frequency and intensity, knowledge of the physiological tree responses is important to better estimate postfire ecosystem dynamics and interactions with climate disturbances.},

Redwood tree basal area growth was more strongly related to sapwood area than to tree size and differed significantly between canopy strata and overstory stratum crown classes. Projected leaf area was predicted from sapwood area for each tree, and summarized to the stand level, giving a maximum stand leaf area index (LAI) estimate of 14.9~m2/m2. Redwood tree growing space efficiency (GSE; the ratio of stem volume increment to leaf area) was greatest on average among emergent overstory trees, followed by dominant and codominant overstory trees. There was no evidence of declining overstory tree GSE with increasing leaf area over the range of data collected. A nonlinear model predicted increasing understory tree GSE with increasing leaf area.

  abstract = {Fuel moisture content is an important variable for forest fires because it affects fuel ignition and fire behavior. In order to accurately predict fuel ignition potential, fuel moisture content must be assessed by evaluating fire spread, fireline intensity and fuel consumption. Our objective here is to model moisture content of surface fuels in normally stocked Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) stands in relation to weather conditions, namely temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed in the Mugla province of Turkey. All surface fuels were categorized according to diameter classes and fuel types. Six fuel categories were defined: these were 0\textendash 0.3, 0.3\textendash 0.6, and 0.6\textendash 1~cm diameter classes, and cone, surface litter, and duff. Plastic containers 15\,\texttimes\,20~cm in size with 1\,\texttimes\,1~mm mesh size were used. Samples were taken from 09:00 to 19:00~h and weighed every 2~h with 0.01~g precision for 10~days in August. At the end of the study, samples were taken to the laboratory, oven-dried at 105~\textdegree C for 24~h and weighed to obtain fuel-moisture contents. Weather measurements were taken from a fully automated weather station set up at the study site prior to the study. Correlation and regression analyses were carried out and models were developed to predict fuel moisture contents for desorption and adsorption phase for each fuel type categories. Practical fuel moisture prediction models were developed for dry period. Models were developed that performed well with reasonable accuracy, explaining up to 92 and 95.6\% of the variability in fuel-moisture contents for desorption and adsorption phases, respectively. Validation of the models were conducted using an independent data set and known fuel moisture prediction models. The predictive power of the models was satisfactory with mean absolute error values being 1.48 and 1.02 for desorption and adsorption as compared to the 2.05 and 1.60 values for the Van Wagner's hourly litter moisture content prediction model. Results obtained in this study will be invaluable for fire management planning and modeling.},

  abstract = {Aerial and satellite imagery are widely used to assess the severity and impact of wildfires. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a newer remote sensing technology that has demonstrated utility in measuring vegetation structure. Combined use of imagery and LiDAR may improve the assessment of wildfire impacts compared to imagery alone. Estimation of tree mortality at the plot scale could serve for more rapid, broad-scale, and lower cost post-fire assessments than feasible through field assessment. We assessed the accuracy of classifying color-infrared imagery in combination with post-fire LiDAR, and with differenced (pre- and post-fire) LiDAR, in estimating plot percent mortality in a second-growth coast redwood forest near Santa Cruz, CA. Percent mortality of trees greater than 25.4 cm DBH in 47 permanent 0.08 ha plots was categorized as low ({$<$}25\%), moderate (25\%\textendash 50\%), or high ({$>$}50\%). The model using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) was 74\% accurate; the model using NDVI and post-fire LiDAR was 85\% accurate, while the model using NDVI and differenced LiDAR was 83\% accurate. The addition of post-fire LiDAR data provided a modest increase in accuracy compared to imagery alone, which may not justify the substantial cost of data acquisition. The method demonstrated could be applied to rapidly estimate tree mortality resulting from wildfires at fine to moderate scale.},

  abstract = {Interest in prescribed fire science has grown over the past few decades due to the increasing application of prescribed fire by managers to mitigate wildfire hazards, restore biodiversity, and improve ecosystem resilience. Numerous ecological disciplines use prescribed fire experiments to provide land managers with evidence-based information to support prescribed fire management. Documenting variation in the context and conditions during prescribed fire experimental treatments is critical for management inference, but inconsistencies in reporting critical experimental details can complicate interpretation. Such details are needed to provide ecological and empirical context for data, facilitate experimental replication, enable meta-analyses, and maximize utility for other scientists and practitioners. To evaluate reporting quality in the recent literature, we reviewed 219 prescribed fire experiments from 16 countries published in 11 refereed journals over the last 5 years. Our results suggest substantial shortcomings in the reporting of critical data that compromise the utility of this research. Few studies had specific information on burning conditions such as fuel moisture (22\%), quantitative fuel loads (36\%), fire weather (53\%), and fire behavior (30\%). Further, our analysis revealed that 63\% of the studies provided precise coordinates for their study area, while 30\% of studies indicated the prescribed fire date. Only 54\% of the studies provided descriptions of the ignition characteristics. Given these common deficiencies, we suggest minimum reporting standards for future prescribed fire experiments. These standards could be applied to journal author guidelines, directed to researchers and reviewers by the editor, and promoted in the education of fire ecologists. Establishing reporting standards will increase the quality, applicability, and reproducibility of prescribed fire science, facilitate future research syntheses, and foster actionable science.},

  abstract = {Diameter distributions are an important source of information for estimating the timber assortment in forest stands. In this paper, a one-step procedure for deriving the parameters of a Weibull function, itself used to describe diameter distributions, is presented. A generalized linear model (GLM) is employed that allows for an estimation of the shape and scale parameters as functions of different predictors. The GLM was fit using 495~sample plots from a conventional sample-plot inventory. Plotwise height metrics derived from airborne laser scanner data serve as covariates (auxiliary variables). Each sample plot consists of four concentric circle plots, where the largest plot covers an area of 450~m2 (12~m radius). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) {$<$}30~cm are measured only on the smaller circle plots. Because of this design, left- and right-truncated Weibull distributions, conditional on the DBH, were used to fit the data. The frequently used two-step procedure\,\textemdash\,in which the Weibull distribution is firstly fitted via maximum likelihood, and its parameters are then estimated via linear regression\,\textemdash\,requires an adequate number of observations per sample plot in the first step. Hence, this method would have been unsuitable for the data source at hand, because a mean of just 12~trees per sample plot was recorded. The visual comparison of the predicted Weibull distributions with observed data shows a good fit to the data. The mean of the DBH distributions was estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.44~cm and a bias of 0.41~cm.},

  abstract = {Methods characterizing fine-scale fuels and plant diversity can advance understanding of plant-fire interactions across scales and help in efforts to monitor important ecosystems such as longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests of the southeastern United States. Here, we evaluate the utility of close-range photogrammetry for measuring fuels and plant diversity at fine scales (submeter) in a longleaf pine forest. We gathered point-intercept data of understory plants and fuels on nine 3-m2 plots at a 10-cm resolution. For these same plots, we used close-range photogrammetry to derive 3-dimensional (3D) point clouds representing understory plant height and color. Point clouds were summarized into distributional height and density metrics. We grouped 100 cm2 cells into fuel types, using cluster analysis. Comparison of photogrammetry heights with point-intercept measurements showed that photogrammetry points were weakly to moderately correlated to plant and fuel heights (r = 0.19\textendash 0.53). Mann\textendash Whitney pairwise tests evaluating separability of fuel types, species, and plant types in terms of photogrammetry metrics were significant 44\%, 41\%, and 54\% of the time, respectively. Overall accuracies using photogrammetry metrics to classify fuel types, species, and plant types were 44\%, 39\%, and 44\%, respectively.

  abstract = {We reconstructed fire history in old-growth coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) stands along an ocean-to-inland gradient in Jackson Demonstration State Forest on the Mendocino Coast in northern California, USA. Fire history was reconstructed for the past two to four centuries using fire scars recorded in tree rings. Surface fires were frequent disturbances in all stands prior to the early twentieth century. Composite mean fire-free intervals aggregated within stands varied from 6 to 20 years, and point mean fire-free intervals averaged within trees varied from 9 to 20 years. Fires ceased in the early 20th century coincident with the advent of organized fire suppression efforts beginning in the 1930s. Fire frequency did not vary significantly along the ocean-inland gradient. Although several of the inland stands tended to record shorter intervals between fires, there was high variability among sites. These and analogous fire-scar data from other studies across the range of coast redwood forests suggest that fire frequencies have been underestimated in some past assessments. A principal reason is that fire-scar records on coast redwood trees are difficult to locate because of inadequate preservation compared to other species that experienced surface fires. Cessation of surface fires has resulted in shifts in fuel and forest structure over recent decades, and the fire history reconstructed by this study provides both guidelines and justification for ecological restoration efforts in coast redwood forests of this region.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is expected to increase fire frequency in many productive obligate seeder forests, where repeated high-intensity fire can initiate stand conversion to alternative states with contrasting structure. These vegetation\textendash fire interactions may modify the direct effects of climate warming on the microclimatic conditions that control dead fuel moisture content (FMC), which regulates fire activity in these high-productivity systems. However, despite the well-established role of forest canopies in buffering microclimate, the interaction of FMC, alternative forest states and their role in vegetation\textendash fire feedbacks remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that FMC dynamics across alternative states would vary to an extent meaningful for fire and that FMC differences would be attributable to forest structural variability, with important implications for fire-vegetation feedbacks. FMC was monitored at seven alternative state forested sites that were similar in all aspects except forest type and structure, and two proximate open-weather stations across the Central Highlands in Victoria, Australia. We developed two generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) using daily independent and autoregressive (i.e., lagged) input data to test the importance of site properties, including lidar-derived forest structure, in predicting FMC from open weather. There were distinct differences in fuel availability (days when FMC {$<$} 16\%, dry enough to sustain fire) leading to positive and negative fire\textendash vegetation feedbacks across alternative forest states. Both the independent (r2 = 0.551) and autoregressive (r2 = 0.936) models ably predicted FMC from open weather. However, substantial improvement between models when lagged inputs were included demonstrates nonindependence of the automated fuel sticks at the daily level and that understanding the effects of temporal buffering in wet forests is critical to estimating FMC. We observed significant random effects (an analogue for forest structure effects) in both models (p {$<$} 0.001), which correlated with forest density metrics such as light penetration index (LPI). This study demonstrates the importance of forest structure in estimating FMC and that across alternative forest states, differences in fuel availability drive vegetation\textendash fire feedbacks with important implications for forest flammability.},

  abstract = {Wildland fire managers are often required to predict tree injury and mortality when planning a prescribed burn or when considering wildfire management options; and, currently, statistical models based on post-fire observations are the only tools available for this purpose. Implicit in the derivation of statistical models is the assumption that they are strictly applicable only for the species or conditions for which they were developed. The result has been a profusion of separate models of uncertain generality. A parallel research effort, the process approach, has been directed at modeling tree injury and mortality by directly simulating the energy-transfer process from the fire to the exterior surface of the plant, and thence into roots, stems, and foliage. Process models can currently predict stem or tree death if certain injury thresholds are reached. We present a brief review of the current understanding of the biophysical processes causing fire-induced plant injury, and focus on the challenges associated with defining boundary conditions, initial conditions, and thermal and physical properties required for modeling plant heating and tissue necrosis. We argue for integration of statistical and process approaches to predicting tree injury and mortality wherein process models provide inputs for statistical models. Research gaps that hinder the application of process-based tree injury and mortality models include linkage of fire effects models with combustion models (especially coupled fire-atmosphere models) through the boundary conditions required for simulating tissue heating, descriptions of live tree thermal and physical characteristics, and better understanding of the physiological basis for delayed fire-caused mortality and the interactions between fire injury and second-order causes of mortality such as diseases and insects.},

The combination of structurally and radiometrically accurate 3D ``virtual'' forests with radiative transfer (RT) models creates a powerful tool to facilitate the calibration and validation of remote sensing data and derived biophysical products by helping us understand the assumptions made in data processing algorithms. We present a workflow that uses highly detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to generate virtual forests for RT model simulations. Our approach to forest stand reconstruction from a co-registered point cloud is unique as it models each tree individually. Our approach follows three steps: (1) tree segmentation; (2) tree structure modelling and (3) leaf addition. To demonstrate this approach, we present the measurement and construction of a one hectare model of the deciduous forest in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK). The model contains 559 individual trees. We matched the TLS data with traditional census data to determine the species of each individual tree and allocate species-specific radiometric properties. Our modelling framework is generic, highly transferable and adjustable to data collected with other TLS instruments and different ecosystems. The Wytham Woods virtual forest is made publicly available through an online repository.},

Post-fire tree and stem mortality have been traditionally modeled as a simple empirical function of tree defenses (e.g., bark thickness) and fire injury (e.g., crown scorch). We used the Fire and Tree Mortality database (FTM)\textemdash which includes observations of tree mortality in obligate seeders and stem mortality in basal resprouting species from across the USA\textemdash to evaluate the accuracy of post-fire mortality models used in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) software system. The basic model in FOFEM, the Ryan and Amman (R-A) model, uses bark thickness and percentage of crown volume scorched to predict post-fire mortality and can be applied to any species for which bark thickness can be calculated (184 species-level coefficients are included in the program). FOFEM (v6.7) also includes 38 species-specific tree mortality models (26 for gymnosperms, 12 for angiosperms), with unique predictors and coefficients. We assessed accuracy of the R-A model for 44 tree species and accuracy of 24 species-specific models for 13 species, using data from 93 438 tree-level observations and 351 fires that occurred from 1981 to 2016.},

While there have been extensive efforts at modeling the probability and severity of wildfires, there have been fewer efforts to examine causal linkages from wildfires to impacts on ecological receptors and critical habitats. Bayesian networks are probabilistic tools for graphing and evaluating causal knowledge and uncertainties in complex systems that have seen only limited application to the quantitative assessment of ecological risks and impacts of wildfires. Here, we explore opportunities for using Bayesian networks for assessing wildfire impacts to ecological systems through levels of causal representation and scenario examination. Ultimately, Bayesian networks may facilitate understanding the factors contributing to ecological impacts, and the prediction and assessment of wildfire risks to ecosystems.

Eight common Mediterranean fuel complexes managed by means of prescribed burning in limestone Provence (South-Eastern France) were studied, illustrating forest and woodland, garrigue and grassland situations. The coupled atmosphere-wildfire behaviour model FIRETEC was used to simulate fire behaviour (ROS, intensity) in these complex vegetations. The temporal threshold related to the effectiveness of prescribed burning in reducing the fire hazard was assessed from derivated fuel dynamics after treatment. The study showed that prescribed burning treatment was effective for the first two years in most of the Mediterranean plant communities analysed. Thereafter, all forests and shrublands were highly combustible with a fire line intensity of more than 5000kW/m except for pine stands with or without oak (medium intensity of 2000kWm-1 3 years after treatment). Low fire line intensity (900kWm-1) was obtained for grassland which was entirely treatment-independent since the resprouter hemicryptophyte, Brachypodium retusum, is highly resilient to fire. Fire behaviour was greatly affected by fuel load accumulation of Quercus ilex in woodland, and by standing necromass of Rosmarinus officinalis in treated garrigue. Pure pine stands with shrub strata similar to garrigue showed a lower fire intensity due to wind speed decrease at ground level under tree canopy, underlining the advantage of maintaining a proportion of canopy cover in strategic fuel-break zones.},

Independent of its biological nature, characterizing how readily vegetation could burn as fuels is required to describe and model fire behavior and fire effects for multiple fire science and management applications. Fire behavior terms apply to either flaming and smoldering combustion, except when preceded by a qualifier. Our book, Fire Science: From Chemistry to Landscape Management, offers a logical progression of combustion to vegetation dynamics.

  abstract = {Accurate description of forest surface fuel load is important for understanding bushfire behaviour and suppression difficulties, predicting ongoing fires for operational activities, assessing potential fire hazards and assisting in fuel hazard-reduction burns to reduce fire risks to the community and the environment. Bushfire related studies and current operational activities have a common challenge in quantifying fuels, since the fuel load varies across the landscape. This paper developed a predictive model that efficiently and accurately estimates quantities of surface fuel in Australian southeast Eucalypt forests. Model coefficients were determined through a three-step process that attempts to evaluate how the spatial variation in surface fuel load relates to litter-bed depth, fuel characteristics, topography and previous fire disturbance. First, the forest surface fuel depth-to-load relationship was established; second, key quantitative variables of environmental factors were added; and third, important qualitative variables of fuel characteristics were included. The verification of model prediction was conducted through leave-one-out cross-validation (CV). Light Detection and Ranging was used to quantify forest structural characteristics and terrain features. The calibrated model had a R2 of 0.89 (RMSE~=~20.7~g) and performed better than the currently used surface fuel load models, including McArthur's (R2~=~0.61 and RMSE~=~39.6~g) and Gilroy and Tran's (R2~=~0.69 and RMSE~=~36.5~g) models. This study describes a novel approach to forest surface fuel load modelling using forest characteristics and environmental factors derived from LiDAR data through statistical analysis. The model established in this study can be used as an efficient approach to assist in forest fuel management and fire related operational activities.},

Tree diameter distribution provides much of the information necessary for sustainable management and can be predicted with high accuracy, thus saving time and financial resources. Permanent sample plots that belong to a permanent sampling network located in a protected area in the South Western Carpathians in Romania were used in this study. We compared two theoretical distribution functions and predicted or recovered their parameters using parameter prediction and parameter recovery methods. Five modeling approaches based on maximum likelihood and the method of moments were used to predict the diameter distribution of unmanaged mixed uneven-aged stands. Parameter recovery methods outperformed parameter prediction methods while the left-truncated Weibull distribution outperformed the complete Weibull distribution. The accuracy obtained by the best modeling approach measured by the relative root mean squared error (\%RMSE) reaches up to 12.6\% when the sums of the diameters are raised to the third power and only 0.02\% and 4.8\% for the sums of the second powers and the sum of the diameters respectively. This research is the first of this kind in Romania and can serve as an example of alternative solutions to the yield tables in estimating the volume of mixed uneven-aged stands and can be easily implemented into forest growth models to predict the diameter distribution in the absence of tree lists.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a coupled fire\textendash atmosphere model that uses a sophisticated high-resolution non-hydrostatic numerical mesoscale model to predict the local winds which are then used as input to the prediction of fire spread. The heat and moisture fluxes from the fire are then fed back to the dynamics, allowing the fire to influence its own mesoscale winds that in turn affect the fire behavior. This model is viewed as a research model and as such requires a fireline propagation scheme that systematically converges with increasing spatial and temporal resolution. To achieve this, a local contour advection scheme was developed to track the fireline using four tracer particles per fuel cell, which define the area of burning fuel. Using the dynamically predicted winds along with the terrain slope and fuel characteristics, algorithms from the BEHAVE system are used to predict the spread rates. A mass loss rate calculation, based on results of the BURNUP fuel burnout model, is used to treat heat exchange between the fire and atmosphere. Tests were conducted with the uncoupled model to test the fire-spread algorithm under specified wind conditions for both spot and line fires. Using tall grass and chaparral, line fires were simulated employing the full fire\textendash atmosphere coupling. Results from two of these experiments show the effects of fire propagation over a small hill. As with previous coupled experiments, the present results show a number of features common to real fires. For example, we show how the well-recognized elliptical fireline shape is a direct result of fire\textendash atmosphere interactions that produce the `heading', `flanking', and `backing' regions of a wind-driven fire with their expected behavior. And, we see how perturbations upon this shape sometimes amplify to become fire whirls along the flanks, which are transported to the head of the fire where they may interact to produce erratic fire behavior.},

Integrated with weather data and airborne and satellite remote sensing data on wildland fuels and active fire detection, modern coupled weather-fire modeling systems are being used to solve current science problems. Compared to legacy tools, these dynamic computational modeling systems increase cost and complexity but have produced breakthrough insights notably into the mechanisms underlying extreme wildfire events such as fine-scale extreme winds associated with interruptions of the electricity grid and have been configured to forecast a fire's growth, expanding our ability to anticipate how they will unfold. We synthesize case studies of recent extreme events, expanding applications, and the challenges and limitations in our remote sensing systems, fire prediction tools, and meteorological models that add to wildfires' mystery and apparent unpredictability.},

Over half of the re-sampled area burned in relatively recent management- and lightning-ignited fires. This allowed for comparisons of both areas that have experienced recent fire and areas with no recent fire, to the same areas historically based on early forest inventories. Our results indicate substantially altered present forest conditions, relative to the 1911 data, and can largely be attributed to the disruption of the key ecosystem process for these forests, fire. For areas that burned recently there was a noticeable difference in forest structure based on fire severity. Current tree density and canopy cover in areas burned recently with moderate severity did not differ from 1911 estimates, while areas that burned recently with low severity or were unburned had higher tree density and canopy cover relative to the 1911 estimates. This emphasizes an important distinction with regard to using fire to restore forests, resting primarily on whether fires kill trees in the lower and intermediate canopy strata. Our results also demonstrate nearly a doubling of live tree carbon stocks in the present forest compared to the historical forest. The findings presented here can be used by managers and ecologists interested in restoring Sierra Nevada mixed conifer systems.},

However, there is a limit to the amount of inference that can be drawn from historical fire reconstructions. Contemporary ``reference'' landscapes may be able to provide information that is not available from historical reconstructions. In this study, we characterized variability in vegetation structure and composition across two Sierra Nevada landscapes with long-established fire restoration programs. We used tree, shrub, and surface fuel data from 117 initial plots, 86 of which were re-measured 8\textendash 12 years later, to identify the mechanisms driving variability in vegetation and fuel conditions. Our analyses identified nine distinct vegetation groups, with mean live tree basal area and density ranging from 0.3 to 72.7m2ha-1 and 2.5 to 620treesha-1 for individual groups. For all plots combined, mean live tree basal area and density was 28.4m2ha-1 and 215treesha-1, but standard deviations (SD) were 29.1m2ha-1 and 182treesha-1, respectively. These ranges and SDs demonstrate considerable variability in vegetation structure, which was partially related to site productivity and previous fire severity. Fine surface fuel loads were generally low (overall mean, 16.1Mgha-1), but also exhibited high variability (SD, 12.6Mgha-1). Surprisingly, surface fuel loads based on initial measurement and change between measurements were not related to fire characteristics. The only statistical relationship found was that surface fuel loads were associated with forest structure and composition. These results capture a contemporary `natural' range of variability and can be used to guide landscape-level restoration efforts. More specifically, these results can help identify distinct targets for variable forest structures across landscapes.},

  abstract = {Aim Temperate forests are currently facing multiple stresses due to climate change, biological invasions, habitat fragmentation and fire regime change. How these stressors interact with each other influences how, when and whether ecosystems recover, or whether they adapt or transition to a different ecological state. Because forest recovery or collapse may take longer than a human lifetime, predicting the outcomes of different stressor combinations remains difficult. A clearer vision of future forest trajectories in a changing world may be gained by examining collapses of forests in the past. Here, we use long-term ecological data to conduct a post-mortem examination of the decline of maritime pine forests (Pinus pinaster Ait.) on the SW Iberian Peninsula 7000\textendash 6500 years ago. Location Portugal and Spain. Methods We compared four palaeoecological records\textemdash two with pine declines and two without\textemdash using a multiproxy approach. Bioclimatic differences between the four sites were explored. Proxies for past vegetation and disturbance (fire and grazing) were compared with independent palaeoclimatic records. We performed functional traits analysis and used phase plots to examine the causes of pine decline. Results The pine decline represents a critical transition in SW Iberia, which lies close to maritime pine's bioclimatic limits. Prolonged drought likely killed trees and suppressed the fires that normally stimulate pine germination and pinewood recovery. Increased grazing pressure facilitated the rapid spread of resprouter shrubs. These competed with pine trees and ultimately replaced them. Our data highlight complex interactions between climate, fire, grazing and forest resilience. Main Conclusions The pine decline occurred at least a century after post-fire resprouters overtook obligate seeders in the vegetation, constituting an early-warning signal of forest loss. Fire suppression, resprouter encroachment and grazing may threaten the persistence of Mediterranean forests as droughts become more frequent and extreme.},

  abstract = {Tree-level productivity is largely determined by crown size and aboveground vigor, but light availability ultimately controls growth. Competition indices are typically used in modeling instead of actual measurements of light. Our goals were to determine which measure of light best predicts trunk growth increments of Sequoia sempervirens, to quantify the amount of growth variation explained by light after accounting for effects of tree structure, and to compare model fitness of various competition indices. Twenty-four trees spanning a wide range of light environments were randomly selected from stands of different ages, including trees 23\textendash 72m tall and 20\textendash 560years old. Tree structure and trunk growth increments were quantified via direct measurements of all branches and coring main trunks at multiple heights. Light availability was quantified via hemispherical photography throughout tree crowns. Competition indices were computed by measuring the size and distribution of neighboring trees. The largest tree had 69m3 of wood and bark, 3208m2 of leaf area, and produced 1.04m3yr-1 of wood in the main trunk, whereas the smallest tree had less than 1m3 of wood and bark, 134m2 of leaf area, and produced 0.04m3yr-1 of wood in the main trunk. After accounting for tree structure, light availability explained an additional 10\% of variation in trunk wood volume increment. Light availability alone explained 49\% of the variation in wood volume increment, while tree size alone explained 41\%. The growth model with average mid-crown openness as the measure of light availability was 19 times more likely than the model without a term for light. A distance-dependent competition index computing neighboring tree crown volume (DDCV) was {$>$}1200 times more likely than any other competition index in the best growth model. Together with tree size and aboveground vigor, DDCV explained 91\% of variation in trunk wood volume increment.},

  abstract = {Changing disturbance regimes and climate can overcome forest ecosystem resilience. Following high-severity fire, forest recovery may be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier postfire climate, or short-interval reburning. A potential outcome of the loss of resilience is the conversion of the prefire forest to a different forest type or nonforest vegetation. Conversion implies major, extensive, and enduring changes in dominant species, life forms, or functions, with impacts on ecosystem services. In the present article, we synthesize a growing body of evidence of fire-driven conversion and our understanding of its causes across western North America. We assess our capacity to predict conversion and highlight important uncertainties. Increasing forest vulnerability to changing fire activity and climate compels shifts in management approaches, and we propose key themes for applied research coproduced by scientists and managers to support decision-making in an era when the prefire forest may not return.},

Thanks to the virtual environment created in Unity\textcopyright, it was possible to obtain variable environmental parameters (amount of light, temperature) used as inputs to the mathematical simulation of growth. The model is based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that compute the growth of each single internode in length (primary growth) and width (secondary growth) and the accumulation of growth inhibitors regulating the seasonal cyclicity of the tree. Virtual experiments were conducted varying environmental conditions (amount of light and temperature), and the species-specific characteristics of the simulated tree (number of buds, branching angle). The results have been analyzed showing also how the model can be adapted for the creation of different tree species and discussing the potential agronomic applications of model.},

Recent advancements in computer graphics allowed researchers and companies to create large-scale virtual environments with growing resolution and complexity. Among the different applications, the generation of biological assets is a relevant task that implies challenges due to the extreme complexity associated with natural structures. An example is represented by trees, whose composition made by thousands of leaves, branches, branchlets, and stems with oriented directions is hard to be modeled. Realistic 3D models of trees can be exploited for a wide range of applications including decision-making support, visualization of ecosystem changes over time, and for simple visualization purposes. In this review, we give an overview of the most common approaches used to generate 3D tree models, discussing both methodologies and available commercial software. We focus on strategies for modeling and rendering of plants, highlighting their accordance or not with botanical knowledge and biological models.

Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i.e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Management Analyst (FMAPlus\`O), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel's surface and crown rate of fire spread models with Van Wagner's crown fire transition and propagation models are shown to have a significant underprediction bias when used in assessing potential crown fire behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and crown fire rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in crown fire rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing crown fire initiation (i.e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt's two crown fire hazard indices are also critically examined.},

We calculated error statistics and contrasted model predictions against observed spread rates of field observations of wildfires and prescribed fires. We then compared the changes in error metrics of older models to newer ones. Evaluation results show newer models to have improved prediction accuracy. Mean absolute errors were reduced by 56\%, 68\% and 70\% in dry eucalypt forests, grasslands and crown fires in conifer forests, respectively. The most significant improvement was the reversion of under-prediction bias achieved with newer models.

A backtracking calibration procedure quantified the surface fuel bed characteristics that best explained the observed rate of fire spread. The study suggested the need for two distinct fuel models to adequately characterise the variability in fire behaviour in this fuel type. In these heterogeneous fuel beds the fuel models do not necessarily represent the inventoried average fuel conditions. Evaluation against the modelling data produced mean absolute errors of 0.8 and 0.6 m min\textendash 1 in rate of spread, respectively, for the litter and understorey fuel models, with little evidence of bias. The fuel models predicted the rate of spread of a validation dataset with comparable error. Comparison of the behaviour and evaluation statistics produced by the study fuel models with fuel models developed from inventoried fuel data alone revealed an improvement on model performance for the current study approach for the litter fuel model and comparable behaviour for the understorey one. We examined model behaviour through comparative analysis with models used operationally to predict fire spread in pine stands. Large departures from model behaviour essentially occur when the models are exercised outside the range of the model development dataset. The discrepancies in predicted fire behaviour were hypothesised to arise not from differences in fuel complex structure but from the selected functional relationships that determine the effect of wind and fuel moisture on rate of spread.},

This paper describes the modeling of two fundamental crown fire behavior features: the onset of crowning and the spread rate of crown fires. The present study is based largely on the database used in the development of the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System. The dataset used in the study consisted of 73 experimental fires in various coniferous forest fuel complexes, 40 of which were classified as crown fires. These fires cover a wide spectrum of fire environment conditions and fire behavior characteristics, with rates of spread ranging from 0.5 - 49.4 m/min, and fireline intensity from 62 \textendash{} 45,200 kW/m. Crown fire initiation was modeled through a logistic regression approach using 10-m open wind speed, fuel strata gap or height to live crown base, a surface fuel consumption class, and an index of fine dead fuel moisture content as independent variables. Spread rates for active and passive crown fires were modeled through multiple non-linear regression analysis following physical reasoning. Independent variables used in the crown fire spread models were 10-m open wind speed, canopy bulk density and again the index of fine dead fuel moisture content. The crown fire initiation model correctly predicted 85 \% of the cases in the dataset used for its construction. The active crown fire spread model yield a R2 of 0.61. The wide variation in fuel complex structure and fire behavior in datasets used to build the crown fire initiation and rate of spread models gives confidence that the models might work well in fuel complexes different from the original ones, given an adequate description of the physical characteristics of the fuel complex.},

On the basis of a compilation of 49 fire spread model evaluation datasets involving 1278 observations in seven different fuel type groups, the limits on the predictability of current operational models are examined. Only 3\% of the predictions (i.e. 35 out of 1278) were considered to be exact predictions according to the criteria used in this study. Mean percent error varied between 20 and 310\% and was homogeneous across fuel type groups. Slightly more than half of the evaluation datasets had mean errors between 51 and 75\%. Under-prediction bias was prevalent in 75\% of the 49 datasets analysed. A case is made for suggesting that a {$\pm$}35\% error interval (i.e. approximately one standard deviation) would constitute a reasonable standard for model performance in predicting a wildland fire's forward or heading rate of spread. We also found that empirical-based fire behaviour models developed from a solid foundation of field observations and well accepted functional forms adequately predicted rates of fire spread far outside of the bounds of the original dataset used in their development.},

Treatments were conducted in 15\textendash 25-year-old mixed redwood/Douglas-fir stands and consisted of high-density, low-density, and localized release thinning, as well as a control. Four years post-treatment, data collected from 60 large plots in 20 stands spread across the Mill Creek and Rock Creek watersheds in Del Norte County, California, indicated that spatial variability created from thinning treatments was reflected in diameter growth. Trees having no crown competition had on average a 33\% greater basal area increment than trees surrounded by neighboring trees. Thinning treatments enhanced redwood representation by preferentially removing other species, but also promoted rapid growth which increased incidences of bear damage. Approximately 25\% of redwood trees sustained bear damage in thinned stands. The localized release thinning created a mosaic of circles flanked by unthinned patches within which trees grew slowly. Localized release created more heterogeneity in tree size but did not generate significantly greater fuel bed depths, result in more bear damage, or represent any sacrifice in understory light or plant abundance and species diversity than a more conventional approach to thinning.},

  abstract = {The spatial patterns of trees were investigated in old-growth redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) forests located in northern California to guide the design of restoration prescriptions. All stems \dbend 15 cm dbh were mapped and measured on three 1.5-ha plots. Patterns for trees in different size classes were analyzed separately with Ripley's K(d) function. Results revealed two patterns. At two sites, trees were randomly distributed throughout the stand and size classes were spatially independent of each other at scales of 0\textendash 50 m. At one site, a clumped spatial pattern was revealed for small- and medium-sized tree groups at small scales, whereas a random spatial pattern was detected for large trees at scales of 0\textendash 50 m. In addition, significant positive deviation from spatial independence at small scales suggested an attraction between tree groups. The spatial pattern of regeneration (trees \dbend 15 cm dbh) was described using quadrat-based analyses. Regeneration was clumped at all three sites. Results indicate that old-growth redwood forests occurring on alluvial flats have different spatial patterns for similar size classes of trees despite the similarities in topography and stand structural characteristics. For land managers interested in restoration, these results suggest that past thinning guides that emphasized uniform spacing may not be appropriate in restoration efforts. Instead, trees should be retained in clumps or in random spatial patterns.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are a global crisis, but current fire models fail to capture vegetation response to changing climate. With drought and elevated temperature increasing the importance of vegetation dynamics to fire behavior, and the advent of next generation models capable of capturing increasingly complex physical processes, we provide a renewed focus on representation of woody vegetation in fire models. Currently, the most advanced representations of fire behavior and biophysical fire effects are found in distinct classes of fine-scale models and do not capture variation in live fuel (i.e., living plant) properties. We demonstrate that plant water and carbon dynamics, which influence combustion and heat transfer into the plant and often dictate plant survival, provide the mechanistic linkage between fire behavior and effects. Our conceptual framework linking remotely sensed estimates of plant water and carbon to fine scale models of fire behavior and effects could be a critical first step toward improving the fidelity of the coarse scale models that are now relied upon for global fire forecasting. This process-based approach will be essential to capturing the influence of physiological responses to drought and warming on live fuel conditions, strengthening the science needed to guide fire managers in an uncertain future.},

  abstract = {While logging is used at times to reduce fuel continuity and subsequent fire behavior, there is an inherent increase in down woody fuels from logging slash immediately after harvest, which then potentially serves to create intense, fast spreading wildfires. Stands of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) on the Valencia forest near Santa Cruz, California were selectively harvested in late fall of 2002 according to prescriptions written by faculty within the Natural Resources Management Department at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo. Various units were either tractor-skidded or cable logged to designated landings depending on terrain and access. The harvest was consistent with the overall mission of implementing an uneven-aged management strategy at Valencia (Piirto et al. 1997). Because fuel depth and loading play a significant role in fire intensity and rate of spread in redwood forests (Nives 1989), these redwood stands could be at an elevated risk of wildfire following the 2002 harvest. Therefore, this study examined fuel loading and potential fire behavior immediately before and after the selective harvest to evaluate the potential fire hazard in the residual stand. Further, it sought to better understand the effect of yarding technique on fire hazard to determine if additional fuel mitigation is warranted on some areas after harvest.},

They are also very hard to measure and so tend to be underrepresented in measurements and models of AGB. We show the first detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) estimates of the volume and AGB of large coastal redwood Sequoia sempervirens trees from three sites in Northern California, representing some of the highest biomass ecosystems on Earth. Our TLS estimates agree to within 2\% AGB with a species-specific model based on detailed manual crown mapping of 3D tree structure. However TLS-derived AGB was more than 30\% higher compared to widely-used general (non species-specific) allometries. We derive an allometry from TLS that spans a much greater range of tree size than previous models and so is potentially better-suited for use with new Earth Observation data for these exceptionally high biomass areas. We suggest that where possible, TLS and crown mapping should be used to provide complementary, independent 3D structure measurements of these very large trees.},

Because fires have been uncommon in redwood forests over the past 80 years, managers have limited data to make decisions about the post-fire environment. In June 2008, a series of lightning storms moved through northern California igniting numerous fires throughout the redwood region of Mendocino County. Here, we collected fire-injury data on 1024 redwood trees on commercial timberlands three months after the fire and quantified mortality and biological responses one year later. Although over half the sampled trees had at least 90 percent of their crowns scorched, only 18.2 percent were completely top-killed after one year; and 87.7 percent of this mortality was confined to trees less than 20.3 cm in diameter. Over 80 percent of the trees regenerated leaves and shoots from axillary buds, and a similar percentage resprouted basally. Logistic regression modeling indicated that diameter at breast height (DBH), cambium kill, and percent crown scorch were significant predictors of tree mortality. These results indicate that although small redwoods are predicted to have the highest mortality, their ability to resprout may obviate the need for replanting in areas where redwood is dominant. The management implications for the larger surviving trees are less clear and require further longterm study to examine delayed mortality, growth rates, and wood quality.},

The drawbacks of the experimental measurements and the influence of ambient wind fluctuations that cannot all be captured by the model do not allow conclusive comparisons regarding turbulent statistics and fluxes during the fire period.},

  abstract = {The propagation of a wildfire through a Mediterranean pine stand was simulated using a multiphase physical model of fire behaviour. The heterogeneous character of the vegetation was taken into account using families of solid particles, i.e. the solid phases (foliage, twigs, grass). The thermal decomposition of the solid fuel by drying and pyrolysis, and the combustion of chars were considered, as well as the radiative and convective heat transfer between the gas and the vegetation. In the gaseous phase, turbulence was modelled using a two transport equations model (RNG k\textendash{$\epsilon$}) and the rate of combustion, which was assumed to be controlled by the turbulent mixing of fuel and oxygen, was calculated using an eddy dissipation concept. The radiation transfer equation, which includes absorption and emission of both the gas\textendash soot mixture and the vegetation, was solved to calculate the contribution of radiation to the energy balance equations. Numerical solutions were calculated in a two-dimensional domain (vertical plane). Results showed the ability of this approach to simulate the propagation of a crown fire and to test the efficiency of a fuel break with success. The effects of the terrain slope were also tested. Some effects on fire behaviour of vortices resulting from the interaction of the wind flow with the canopy layer are shown.},

These tree allometries are often attributed to optimisation of hydraulic sap transport and safety against elastic buckling. Here, we show that these allometries also emerge from a model that includes competition for light, wind biomechanics and no hydraulics. We have developed MECHATREE, a numerical model of trees growing and evolving on a virtual island. With this model, we identify the fittest growth strategy when trees compete for light and allocate their photosynthates to grow seeds, create new branches or reinforce existing ones in response to wind-induced loads. Strikingly, we find that selected trees species are self-similar and follow allometric scalings similar to those observed on dicots and conifers. This result suggests that resistance to wind and competition for light play an essential role in determining tree allometries.},

  abstract = {Almost half of Redwood National Park is comprised of second-growth forests characterized by high stand density, deficient redwood composition, and low understory biodiversity. Typical structure of young redwood stands impedes the recovery of old-growth conditions, such as dominance of redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.), distinct canopy layers and diverse understory vegetation. Young forests are commonly comprised of dense, even-aged Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and redwood stump sprouts, with simple canopy structure and little understory development. Moreover, many of these young stands are believed to be vulnerable to disturbance in the form of drought, disease and fire. Silvicultural practices are increasingly being employed by conservation agencies to restore degraded forests throughout the coast redwood range; however, prescribed fire treatments are less common and potentially under-utilized as a restoration tool. We present an early synthesis from three separate management-scale prescribed fire projects at Redwood National Park spanning 1to 7 years post-treatment. Low intensity prescribed fire had minimal effect on overstory structure, with some mortality observed in trees smaller than 30 cm diameter. Moderate to high intensity fire may be required to reduce densities of larger Douglas-fir, the primary competitor of redwood in the Park's second growth forests. Fine woody surface fuels fully recovered by 7 years post-burn, while recruitment of larger surface fuels was quite variable. Managers of coastal redwood ecosystems will benefit by having a variety of tools at their disposal for forest restoration and management.},

However, concern has been expressed that opening stands might lead to greater drying of surface fuels, contributing to increased fire risk. The objective of this study was to determine whether woody fuel moisture differed between unthinned and thinned mixed-conifer stands. Sections of logs representing the 1000- and 10 000-h fuel sizes were placed at 72 stations within treatment units in the fall (autumn) of 2007. Following snow-melt in 2008, 10-h fuel sticks were added and all fuels were weighed every 1\textendash 2 weeks from May until October. Moisture of the 1000- and 10 000-h fuels peaked at the end of May, and then decreased steadily through the season. Moisture of the 10- and 1000-h fuels did not differ between unthinned and thinned stands at any measurement time. The 10 000-h fuel moisture was significantly less in thinned than unthinned stands only in early to mid-May. Overall, even when fuel moisture varied between treatments, differences were small. The long nearly precipitation-free summers in northern California appear to have a much larger effect on fuel moisture than the amount of canopy cover. Fuel moisture differences resulting from stand thinning would therefore not be expected to substantially influence fire behaviour and effects during times of highest fire danger in this environment.},

Fire hazard is usually expressed as predicted potential fire behavior, which is sensitive to the methodology used to quantitatively describe fuel profiles: methodologies that assume that fuel is distributed uniformly throughout crowns have been shown to predict less severe fire behavior than those that assume more realistic nonuniform fuel distributions. We used crown fuel data from seven interior western United States conifer species to characterize within-crown fuel distributions. Fuel was shifted upward and concentrated in crowns in crowded stands compared with crowns in open stands, which suggests that the vertical distribution of fuel is shaped by foliage concentration in favorable light environments near the top of crowns and echoes the predictable relationship between crown ratio and stand density. However, unlike crown ratio, the relationship between within-crown foliage distribution and stand density was independent of the shade tolerance of a species. This implies that there is a general relationship between stand density and within-crown fuel distribution for conifers and that species differences in fuel profiles related to shade tolerance are expressed primarily in the relationship between stand density and crown ratio.},

When CBD and CBH are estimated using nonlocal crown fuel biomass allometries and uniform crown fuel distribution assumptions, as is common practice, values may differ from estimates made using local allometries and nonuniform distributions. We estimated CBD and CBH for mostly pure, even-aged stands of seven conifer species by modifying the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator to use nonuniform crown fuel distributions, which allowed us to determine whether distribution effects on CBD and CBH estimates were species specific or general. For two species, we also compared estimates from local and nonlocal allometries to ascertain whether there was a consistent bias in CBD and CBH estimates associated with application of allometries outside their geographic area of origin. Using nonuniform distributions caused consistent increases in average CBD estimates of \textasciitilde 10\textendash 30\% for all species compared to estimates obtained using uniform distributions. Effects on CBH varied. Using local allometries did not result in CBD or CBH estimates that were consistently larger or smaller than those obtained using nonlocal allometries. We conclude that using nonuniform distributions invariably increases estimates of CBD for even-aged conifer stands, whereas effects on CBH estimates are difficult to predict and that allometric relationships vary widely among stands in the southern Rocky Mountains.},

  abstract = {Research Highlights: The impact of variation in fuels and fuel dynamics among forest cover types on the outcome of fuel treatments is poorly understood. This study investigated the potential effects of treatment placement with respect to cover type on the development of potential fire behavior over time for 48 km2 of forest in Colorado, USA. Our findings can inform the placement of fuel treatments in similar forests to maximize their effectiveness and longevity. Background and Objectives: Efficient placement of fuel treatments is essential to maximize the impact of limited resources for fuels management. We investigated how the placement of treatments with respect to forest cover type affected the rate of spread, size, and prevalence of different fire types for simulated wildfires for 50 years after treatment. Materials and Methods: We generated an analysis landscape consisting of two cover types: stands on southerly aspects had low rates of tree growth and regeneration compared to stands on northerly aspects. We then simulated 1) thinning treatments across 20\% of the landscape, with treatments exclusively located on either southerly (`south treatment') or northerly (`north treatment') aspects; 2) subsequent tree growth and regeneration; and 3) wildfires at 10-year intervals. Finally, we used metrics of fuel hazard and potential fire behavior to understand the interplay between stand-level fuel dynamics and related impacts to potential fire behavior across the broader landscape. Results: Although post-treatment metrics of stand-level fuel hazard were similar among treatment scenarios, only the south treatment reduced rates of fire spread and fire size relative to no treatment. Most differences in modeled fire behavior between treatment scenarios disappeared after two decades, despite persistently greater rates of stand-level fuel hazard development post-treatment for the north treatment. For all scenarios, the overall trajectory was of shrinking fires and less crown fire behavior over time, owing to crown recession in untreated stands. Conclusions: Systematic differences among cover types, such as those in our study area, have the potential to influence fuel treatment outcomes. However, complex interactions between treatment effects, topography, and vegetation structure and dynamics warrant additional study.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are dynamic systems with complex responses to environmental variation. In response to pervasive stressors of changing climate and disturbance regimes, many ecosystems are realigning rapidly across spatial scales, in many cases moving outside of their observed historical range of variation into alternative ecological states. In some cases, these new states are transitory and represent successional stages that may ultimately revert to the pre-disturbance condition; in other cases, alternative states are persistent and potentially self-reinforcing, especially under conditions of altered climate, disturbance regimes, and influences of non-native species. These reorganized states may appear novel, but reorganization is a characteristic ecosystem response to environmental variation that has been expressed and documented throughout the paleoecological record. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover or adapt following disturbance, is an emergent property that results from the expression of multiple mechanisms operating across levels of organism, population, and community. We outline a unifying framework of ecological resilience based on ecological mechanisms that lead to outcomes of persistence, recovery, and reorganization. Persistence is the ability of individuals to tolerate exposure to environmental stress, disturbance, or competitive interactions. As a direct expression of life history evolution and adaptation to environmental variation and stress, persistence is manifested most directly in survivorship and continued growth and reproduction of established individuals. When persistence has been overcome (e.g., following mortality from stress, disturbance, or both), populations must recover by reproduction. Recovery requires the establishment of new individuals from seed or other propagules following dispersal from the parent plant. When recovery fails to re-establish the pre-disturbance community, the ecosystem will assemble into a new state. Reorganization occurs along a gradient of magnitude, from changes in the relative dominance of species present in a community, to individual species replacements within an essentially intact community, to complete species turnover and shift to dominance by plants of different functional types, e.g. transition from forest to shrub or grass dominance. When this latter outcome is persistent and involves reinforcing mechanisms, the resulting state represents a vegetation type conversion (VTC), which in this framework represents an end member of reorganization processes. We explore reorganization in greater detail as this phase is increasingly observed but the least understood of the resilience responses. This resilience framework provides a direct and actionable basis for ecosystem management in a rapidly changing world, by targeting specific components of ecological response and managing for sustainable change.},

  abstract = {Complexity of forest structure is an important factor contributing to uncertainty in aboveground biomass estimates. In this study, we present a new method for reducing uncertainty in forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation based on plot-level terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point clouds reconstruction. The method estimates the total AGB of plots with complex structures after automatically performing the steps of ground point filtering, single tree segmentation, and three-dimensional (3D) structure reconstruction. We used plot data from temperate and tropical forest ecosystems to verify the effectiveness of the method, reconstructing a 1300~m2 temperate plantation plot and a 5000~m2 mingled forest plot, respectively. The total biomass of 153 trees in the plantation plot was overestimated by 17.12~\%, and the total biomass of 61 trees in the mingled forest plot was underestimated by 10.88~\%. We found that the uncertainty of aboveground biomass estimation in tropical forests with more complex structures is not necessarily greater than in plantations. Therefore, in large-scale remote sensing observations of forest biomass, the number or area of plots can be increased to reduce the uncertainty of the results caused by the complex structure. The focus of this study is to explore TLS point clouds modeling methods to reduce the uncertainty in AGB estimation caused by the complexity of forest structures, and to provide reference cases for plot-level point clouds reconstruction methods. Forest ecologists can use this method to regularly observe forest growth and obtain indicators related to forest ecology without destroying trees.},

Burning was conducted on 32 plots each containing approximately 150 to 250 redwoods. Binary responses of individual trees were modeled using logistic regression analysis. Percent response of trees on each plot by 5-cm diameter classes was modeled using logistic and nonlinear regression analysis. Tree diameter, surface fuel consumption, flame length, and crown scorch were significant predictors in all models of top killing and basal sprouting. Models relating heights of crown scorch and bark charting to fire and tree characteristics were also developed. The ability of coast redwood to sprout along branches following foliar damage from fire is unusual among conifers and contributes to a low incidence of top killing.},

  abstract = {We explore the basis of understanding wildland fire behaviour with the intention of stimulating curiosity and promoting fundamental investigations of fire spread problems that persist even in the presence of tremendous modelling advances. Internationally, many fire models have been developed based on a variety of assumptions and expressions for the fundamental heat transfer and combustion processes. The diversity of these assumptions raises the question as to whether the absence of a sound and coherent fire spread theory is partly responsible. We explore the thesis that, without a common understanding of what processes occur and how they occur, model reliability cannot be confirmed. A theory is defined as a collection of logically connected hypotheses that provide a coherent explanation of some aspect of reality. Models implement theory for a particular purpose, including hypotheses of phenomena and practical uses, such as prediction. We emphasise the need for theory and demonstrate the difference between theory and modelling. Increasingly sophisticated fire management requires modelling capabilities well beyond the fundamental basis of current models. These capabilities can only be met with fundamental fire behaviour research. Furthermore, possibilities as well as limitations for modelling may not be known or knowable without first having the theory.},

  abstract = {Wildland fires have an irreplaceable role in sustaining many of our forests, shrublands and grasslands. They can be used as controlled burns or occur as free-burning wildfires, but can also be dangerous and destructive to fauna, human communities and natural resources. Through scientific understanding of their behavior, we can develop the tools to reliably use and manage fires across landscapes in ways that are compatible with the constraints of modern society while benefiting the ecosystems.The science of wildland fire is incomplete, however. Even the simplest fire behaviors \textendash{} how fast they spread, how long they burn and how large they get \textendash{} arise from a dynamical system of physical processes interacting in unexplored ways with heterogeneous biological, ecological and meteorological factors across many scales of time and space. The physics of heat transfer, combustion and ignition, for example, operate in all fires at millimeter and millisecond scales but wildfires can become conflagrations that burn for months and exceed millions of hectares.Wildland Fire Behaviour: Dynamics, Principles and Processes~examines what is known and unknown about wildfire behaviors. The authors introduce fire as a dynamical system along with traditional steady-state concepts. They then break down the system into its primary physical components, describe how they depend upon environmental factors, and explore system dynamics by constructing and exercising a nonlinear model. The limits of modelling and knowledge are discussed throughout but emphasized by review of large fire behaviors. Advancing knowledge of fire behaviors will require a multidisciplinary approach and rely on quality measurements from experimental research, as covered in the final chapters.Features:Approaches wildland fire behavior as the product of a dynamical system rather than as a steady-state property of fuels, topography and weatherIntroduces and applies the physical principles of heat transfer, combustion and ignition to the wildland fire contextExplores dynamical fire behaviors using a simplified model of wildfire spreadSurveys the state of knowledge of large wildfire behaviorSummarizes methods for studying fire behaviors at laboratory and field-scales},

Fire history of an old-growth S. sempervirens forest in the Bull Creek watershed in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, northwestern California, was determined by analyzing S. sempervirens basal sprouts, fire scars, and dates of establishment of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Abies grandis. Fire frequency was estimated for watershed zones, for a clearcut area having fire scars, and for the entire study area. Conservative and liberal estimates of the fire cycle were made. Presettlement fire intervals were: 24.6 yr for watershed zones, 31 yr for the area with fire scars, and 13.3 yr for the entire study area. The conservative estimate of the fire cycle was 5 1 .6 yr and the liberal estimate was 26.2 yr. Settlement fire intervals were: 15.6 yr for watershed zones and 7.5 yr for the entire study area. The conservative and liberal estimates of the fire cycle were 16 and 10 yr. Post-settlement fire intervals were: 7.8 yr for the watershed zones, 14 yr for the area with fire scars, and 4.5 yr for the entire study area.

We tested the ability of QUIC-Fire, a fast-running and computationally inexpensive physics-based fire behavior model to numerically reconstruct a large wildfire that burned in a fire-excluded area within the New York\textendash Philadelphia metropolitan area in 2019. We then used QUIC-Fire as a tool to explore how alternate hypothetical management scenarios, such as prescribed burning, could have affected fire behavior. The results of our reconstruction provide a strong demonstration of how QUIC-Fire can be used to simulate actual wildfire scenarios with the integration of local weather and fuel information, as well as to efficiently explore how fire management can influence fire behavior in specific burn units. Our results illustrate how both reductions of fuel load and specific modification of fuel structure associated with frequent prescribed fire are critical to reducing fire intensity and size. We discuss how simulations such as this can be important in planning and training tools for wildland firefighters, and for avenues of future research and fuel monitoring that can accelerate the incorporation of models like QUIC-Fire into fire management strategies.},

  abstract = {The majority of coastal redwood forests are young ( 50 yr old), dense even-aged forests with historically unprecedented high densities of Douglas-fir. These second-growth forests offer diminished biological diversity and wildilife habitat value than remnant old-growth forests, prompting recent efforts to accelerate the development of old-growth characteristics using forest thinning. To better understand changes in fuel characteristics and fire hazard resulting from restoration activities in the region, I measured fuels across a chronosequence of stands thinned one to seven years prior, and compared them with conditions in the unthinned stands. I also analyzed variability in moisture content of litter and woody fuels over a five-month fire season. Finally, to identify mechanisms influencing moisture content I monitored the microclimatic conditions including relative humidity, temperature, and wind speeds in thinned and unthinned stands across the 2013 fire season (May through October). Restoration thinning significantly increased loading of fine woody fuels ( 7.62 cm in diameter). Results revealed that loading of fine fuels in recently thinned stands was 56\% higher than loading in oldest thinnings. Fuel moisture content in all but the 100-hr fuels was found to be lower in thinned stands, but the pattern of moisture loss was similar in thinned and unthinned stands. Although moisture content did not vary with age of fuels, weak trends were observed during drying and wetting periods. Changes in forest structure due to thinning have altered the microclimate at the forest floor, resulting in relative humidity lower by 4.6\%, and air temperature higher by 1.6\textdegree C. My findings suggest that restoration thinning may exacerbate potential fire behavior in young coast redwood - Douglas-fir forests by increasing loading and availability of forest fuel, highlighting the need for subsequent fuels reduction treatments, or alternative thinning prescriptions that better reduce potential fire hazard. While current restoration thinnings in young redwood forests may improve the stand from silvicultural standpoint, these efforts may have the unintended consequences of increasing fire hazard that would limit the desired effectiveness of these treatments.},

The structure of downed detritus populations in five old-growth Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) stands along the north coast of California was assessed using data collected from an intensive network of line intersect sampling transects. Total mass of woody and vegetative detritus ranged between 252 and 619 Mg ha-1 among sites, and volume between 540 and 1400 m3 ha-1. Eighty six percent of DWD mass consisted of logs {$>$} 7.6 cm diameter, four percent consisted of particles {$\leq$} 7.6 cm diameter, and ten percent of DWD mass was litter (Oi ) and duff (Oe and Oa). Forest floor bulk density ranged between 4.9 and 6.3 Mg ha-1 cm-1 and depth between 7.4 and 10.9 cm among sites. Average surface fuel heights ranged between 26.2 and 46.4 cm among sites. These values are among the greatest recorded in any forest ecosystem.},

  abstract = {A study of historic fire regimes in the Monterey Bay area, with emphasis on the coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) community is described. Five distinct historic fire regimes were initially distinguished from the literature on land-use history. Fire scar dating, historical research and fire behavior modeling were used to create maps, or "scenarios," representing fire coverage during each regime. Although effects of ignition and moisture gradient apparently influenced the vegetation pattern in each of the five fire regimes, only three regimes were particularly significant to the vegetation of the area. Prior to human habitation, a lightning fire regime existed which, along with the vegetation, was disturbed by the arrival of humans around 11,000 BP. After adjusting to a series of three burning regimes under different human occupations, the vegetation was again disturbed when fire suppression became effective in the 20th century. The present regime is similar in several respects to that which existed prior to the arrival of humans. We propose that computer modeling of fire behavior combined with historic lightning fire incidence may provide useful information on prehuman fire regimes here and elsewhere.},

A vegetation map was developed by computer assisted analysis of Landsat satellite photography. Mathematical analysis, using techniques in direct and indirect gradient analysis, was then used to discriminate variability in living and dead biomass within each vegetation type. Fire frequency and living and dead biomass were inventoried on 400 sites. A map of dead biomass (fuel) was made using vegetation boundaries. Fire potential was mapped by incorporating fuel, slope, elevation, and projected weather conditions into fire behavior models. A hypothesized perturbation in mean fire interval with the arrival of humans was confirmed, and the consequences of this were quantified in terms of plant succession, tree density, and quantity of dead biomass. The effects of the perturbation are now being reversed by a policy of fire suppression, and observations on this latest trend aid in understanding pre-human vegetation and fire conditions.},

The realism is enhanced via visual and spatial information acquired from images. In contrast to previous approaches that heavily rely on user interaction to segment plants or recover branches in images, our method automatically estimates an accurate depth map of each image and extracts a 3D dense point cloud by exploiting an efficient stereophotogrammetry approach. Taking this point cloud as a soft constraint, we fit a parametric plant representation to simulate the plant growth progress. In this way, we are able to synthesize parametric plant models from real data provided by photos and 3D point clouds. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach by modeling various plants with complex branching structures and significant self-occlusions. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used to reconstruct ground-covering plants, such as bushes and shrubs which have been given little attention in the literature. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by visually and quantitatively comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {Resulting from changing climatic conditions, wildfires have become an existential threat across various countries around the world. The complex dynamics paired with their often rapid progression renders wildfires an often disastrous natural phenomenon that is difficult to predict and to counteract. In this paper we present a novel method for simulating wildfires with the goal to realistically capture the combustion process of individual trees and the resulting propagation of fires at the scale of forests. We rely on a state-of-the-art modeling approach for large-scale ecosystems that enables us to represent each plant as a detailed 3D geometric model. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation for the combustion process of plants - also considering effects such as heat transfer, char insulation, and mass loss - as well as for the propagation of fire through the entire ecosystem. Compared to other wildfire simulations which employ geometric representations of plants such as cones or cylinders, our detailed 3D tree models enable us to simulate the interplay of geometric variations of branching structures and the dynamics of fire and wood combustion. Our simulation runs at interactive rates and thereby provides a convenient way to explore different conditions that affect wildfires, ranging from terrain elevation profiles and ecosystem compositions to various measures against wildfires, such as cutting down trees as firebreaks, the application of fire retardant, or the simulation of rain.},

  abstract = {Implementation of wildfire- and climate-adaptation strategies in seasonally dry forests of western North America is impeded by numerous constraints and uncertainties. After more than a century of resource and land use change, some question the need for proactive management, particularly given novel social, ecological, and climatic conditions. To address this question, we first provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions and fire regimes. Using this framework, we then evaluate evidence of change in contemporary conditions relative to those maintained by active fire regimes, i.e., those uninterrupted by a century or more of human-induced fire exclusion. The cumulative results of more than a century of research document a persistent and substantial fire deficit and widespread alterations to ecological structures and functions. These changes are not necessarily apparent at all spatial scales or in all dimensions of fire regimes and forest and nonforest conditions. Nonetheless, loss of the once abundant influence of low- and moderate-severity fires suggests that even the least fire-prone ecosystems may be affected by alteration of the surrounding landscape and, consequently, ecosystem functions. Vegetation spatial patterns in fire-excluded forested landscapes no longer reflect the heterogeneity maintained by interacting fires of active fire regimes. Live and dead vegetation (surface and canopy fuels) is generally more abundant and continuous than before European colonization. As a result, current conditions are more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire, especially under a rapidly warming climate. Long-term fire exclusion and contemporaneous social-ecological influences continue to extensively modify seasonally dry forested landscapes. Management that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire can moderate ecosystem transitions as forests and human communities adapt to changing climatic and disturbance regimes. As adaptation strategies are developed, evaluated, and implemented, objective scientific evaluation of ongoing research and monitoring can aid differentiation of warranted and unwarranted uncertainties.},

The method should be of particular interest for tree species such as Douglas-fir that have exhibited variation in crown attributes across both their geographic range and genotypes. To model crown profile, the crown was divided into two segments: the portion of the crown above the point where LCW occurs, and the portion below that point. The equation for the upper portion predicted a crown profile that ranged in shape from nearly conic to parabolic, depending on position within the crown and the social status of the tree, as indicated by the ratio of total height divided by diameter at breast height for the tree. The equation for the lower portion predicted a crown profile with a cylindrical shape. This method explained nearly 94\% of the variation in crown width when used with the felled tree measurement of LCW, 87\% with a measurement of LCW taken while the tree was standing, and 83\% with the use of a value for LCW that was predicted from an equation developed from an independent data set.

A tool that can bridge the gap in understanding is a pictorial display of forest components. A pictorial display won't provide the exactitude of traditional methods, but it can provide a basis for promoting the understanding of traditional forms of ecosystem quantification. The VIZ4ST program is such a tool. VIZ4ST uses L-systems to render forest trees. The L-systems are calibrated to existing architectural relationships to eliminate user bias.

  abstract = {The risks, hazards, and relative severity of wildland fires are presented here within the ecological context of historical natural fire regimes, time, space, and process. As the public dialogue on the role and impacts of wildland fire increases, it is imperative for all partners to converge on clear and concise terminology that defines risk, hazard, and the characteristic (or uncharacteristic) nature of wildland fire. These terms must be defined in the context of scale\textemdash both spatial and temporal. The concept of historical natural fire regimes involves a classification of the characteristic, or ``natural'' processes and effects associated with wildland fire occurring in sustainable ecosystems. When a wildland fire occurs within the time, space, and severity parameters of the historical natural fire regime, the fire can be called natural, or ``characteristic''. The milieu of disturbance effects we call catastrophic, such as economic losses, damages to communities and structures, or impacts on short-term aesthetic values involve social, cultural, and economic values and risks\textemdash none is directly associated with ecological values, damages, or risks. In the context of technical risk assessments, the term ``risk'' considers not only the probability of an event, but also includes values and expected losses. However, within the fire community it refers only to the probability of ignition (both man- and lightning-caused). `Hazard' refers to the state of the fuel, exclusive of weather or the environs in which the fuel is found. Unlike many common uses of the term `severity', fire severity refers specifically to the effect a fire has on wildland systems. It is inappropriate to use the term severity to describe the behavior of the fire phenomenon itself. Instead, we should confine its use to that relating only to a fire's effect. Finally, I discuss the limitations and conflicts to integrating all social, cultural, economic, health, and safety values in our public and policy-forming dialogue relating to fire risk, hazard, and severity. Typical risk assessments consider all relevant endpoints, including socio-economic, management, as well as ecological elements. Herein, I use the Black Mountain 2 Fire from August 2003 in the northern Rockies to illustrate the spatiotemporal extent of fire's impacts on the endpoints. When expressed over all affected spatiotemporal scales, the overlay of all endpoints from this synthetic scenario results in a ``decision space'' ranging in time from an hour to a century, and in space ranging from a few square meters to the continent.},

We bring fuels to the forefront of fire ecology through the concept of the Ecology of Fuels (Hiers et al. 2009) [4]. This concept describes a cyclic process between fuels, fire behavior, and fire effects, which ultimately affect future fuel distribution (Mitchell et al. 2009) [5]. Low-intensity surface fires are driven by the variability in fine-scale (sub-m level) fuels (Loudermilk et al. 2012) [6]. Traditional fuel measurement approaches do not capture this variability because they are over-generalized, and do not consider the fine-scale architecture of interwoven fuel types. Here, we introduce a new approach, the ``3D fuels sampling protocol'' that measures fuel biomass at the scale and dimensions useful for characterizing heterogeneous fuels found in low-intensity surface fire regimes. \textbullet Traditional fuel measurements are oversimplified, prone to sampling bias, and unrealistic for relating to fire behavior (Van Wagner, 1968; Hardy et al., 2008) [7,8].\textbullet We developed a novel field sampling approach to measuring 3D fuels using an adjustable rectangular prism sampling frame.

  abstract = {The realm of wildland fire science encompasses both wild and prescribed fires. Most of the research in the broader field has focused on wildfires, however, despite the prevalence of prescribed fires and demonstrated need for science to guide its application. We argue that prescribed fire science requires a fundamentally different approach to connecting related disciplines of physical, natural, and social sciences. We also posit that research aimed at questions relevant to prescribed fire will improve overall wildland fire science and stimulate the development of useful knowledge about managed wildfires. Because prescribed fires are increasingly promoted and applied for wildfire management and are intentionally ignited to meet policy and land manager objectives, a broader research agenda incorporating the unique features of prescribed fire is needed. We highlight the primary differences between prescribed fire science and wildfire science in the study of fuels, fire behavior, fire weather, fire effects, and fire social science. Wildfires managed for resource benefits (``managed wildfires'') offer a bridge for linking these science frameworks. A recognition of the unique science needs related to prescribed fire will be key to addressing the global challenge of managing wildland fire for long-term sustainability of natural resources.},

  abstract = {In ecosystems with frequent surface fire regimes, fire and fuel heterogeneity has been largely overlooked owing to the lack of unburned patches and the difficulty in measuring fire behavior at fine scales (0.1\textendash 10 m). The diverse vegetation in these ecosystems varies at these fine scales. This diversity could be driven by the influences of local interactions among patches of understorey vegetation and canopy-supplied fine fuels on fire behavior, yet no method we know of can capture fine-scale fuel and fire measurements such that these relationships could be rigorously tested. We present here an original method for inventorying of fine-scale fuels and in situ measures of fire intensity within longleaf pine forests of the south-eastern USA. Using ground-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with traditional fuel inventory approaches, we characterized within-fuel bed variation into discrete patches, termed wildland fuel cells, which had distinct fuel composition, characteristics, and architecture that became spatially independent beyond 0.5 m2. Spatially explicit fire behavior was measured in situ through digital infrared thermography. We found that fire temperatures and residence times varied at similar scales to those observed for wildland fuel cells. The wildland fuels cell concept could seamlessly connect empirical studies with numerical models or cellular automata models of fire behavior, representing a promising means to better predict within-burn heterogeneity and fire effects.},

Here we suggest that process-based models are powerful research tools that are useful for investigating a large number of emerging questions in wildland fire sciences. These models can play a particularly important role in advancing our understanding, in part, because they allow their users to evaluate the potential mechanisms and interactions driving fire dynamics and effects from a unique perspective not often available through experimentation alone. For example, process-based models can be used to conduct experiments that would be impossible, too risky, or costly to do in the physical world. They can also contribute to the discovery process by inspiring new experiments, informing measurement strategies, and assisting in the interpretation of physical observations. Ultimately, a synergistic approach where simulations are continuously compared to experimental data, and where experiments are guided by the simulations will profoundly impact the quality and rate of progress towards solving emerging problems in wildland fire sciences.},

Detailed physics-based modeling approaches such as FIRETEC and the Wildland Urban Interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) simulate fire behavior using computational fluid dynamics based methods to numerically solve the three-dimensional, time dependent, model equations that govern, to some approximation, the component physical processes and their interactions that drive fire behavior. Both of these models have had limited evaluation and have not been assessed for predicting crown fire behavior. In this paper, we utilized a published set of field-scale measured crown fire rate of spread (ROS) data to provide a coarse assessment of crown fire ROS predictions from previously published studies that have utilized WFDS or FIRETEC. Overall, 86\% of all simulated ROS values using WFDS or FIRETEC fell within the 95\% prediction interval of the empirical data, which was above the goal of 75\% for dynamic ecological modeling. However, scarcity of available empirical data is a bottleneck for further assessment of model performance.},

The underlying mechanisms of fire-caused tree mortality remain poorly understood, however, limiting the ability to accurately predict mortality and develop robust modeling applications, especially under novel future climates. Virtually all post-fire tree mortality prediction systems are based on the same underlying empirical model described in Ryan and Reinhardt (1988 Can. J. For. Res. 18 1291\textendash 7), which was developed from a limited number of species, stretching model assumptions beyond intended limits. We review the current understanding of the mechanisms of fire-induced tree mortality, provide recommended standardized terminology, describe model applications and limitations, and conclude with key knowledge gaps and future directions for research. We suggest a two-pronged approach to future research: (1) continued improvements and evaluations of empirical models to quantify uncertainty and incorporate new regions and species and (2) acceleration of basic, physiological research on the proximate and ultimate causes of fire-induced tree mortality to incorporate processes of tree death into models. Advances in both empirical and process fire-induced tree modeling will allow creation of hybrid models that could advance understanding of how fire injures and kills trees, while improving prediction accuracy of fire-driven feedbacks on ecosystems and landscapes, particularly under novel future conditions.},

While initial impacts of fuel treatments have been reported, less is known about treatment longevity as live and dead fuels change with time. We analyzed fuel dynamics in ponderosa pine\textendash Douglas-fir forests 21\textendash 23 years following experimental fuel reduction designed as two independent studies of cutting combined with burning: one tested a commercial thinning strategy, while a second tested a retention shelterwood strategy to reduce fuels while also restoring ponderosa pine forests. Treated units were harvested in 1992 and half of the units were prescribed burned 1 to 2 years later. After 22 to 23 years post-treatment, few differences in fuel load persist and all treatments have increased ladder fuels in the form of live saplings and seedlings. Canopy fuel loads were lower in treated units compared to untreated control units; however, no other canopy fuel metric differed between treatments. The only persistent difference in surface fuels was in the retention shelterwood, where 1 h fuels were lower in the treated units compared to control units. Crown fire hazard varied greatly, but means were similar between treatments. The increased hazard was driven by increases in live surface fuels from seedlings and saplings in the retention shelterwood, which increased canopy bulk density and reduced canopy base height. The overstory was still dominated by ponderosa pine 22\textendash 23 years later for all treatments, but the smaller size classes were primarily Douglas-fir, suggesting that without future disturbance, dominance will shift from pine to Douglas-fir dominated forests. The exception to this was the cut+fall burn treatment in the commercial thinning, where ponderosa pine outnumbered Douglas-fir trees across all size classes. The treatments that included a broadcast prescribed burn killed many existing seedlings and saplings. Our findings support other studies showing fuel reduction and restoration treatments are most successful with a combination of cutting and burning strategies, but also show that fuel treatments in low-elevation dry forests will likely not remain effective for much longer than historical mean fire return intervals.},

Two sets of models were created: one for use in pre-fire planning in which only crown injury and tree diameter (DBH) were potential variables, and a second, optimal model for use in post-fire planning that used all significant variables. Predictive accuracy of all models was compared to the accuracy of the general, non-species specific mortality model used in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) prior to version 5.7. The new species-specific models improved prediction of fire-caused tree mortality by 0 \% to 48 \%. Model accuracy increased the most for red fir, incense cedar, western larch, and whitebark pine, and increased the least for Engelmann spruce. The models in the post-fire option provided higher accuracy compared to the pre-fire models, but also required additional inputs. These new models were added to FOFEM beginning with version 5.7, and the options in the FOFEM Mortality Module were expanded. We describe the new options in FOFEM and how to use the software to predict tree mortality for pre-fire and post-fire planning, as well as modeling limitations and assumptions. The additions to FOFEM offer improved accuracy in predicting post-fire tree mortality for 12 Western conifer species and allow direct inputs of fire injury to increase software applicability to prescribed fire and post-fire forest management.},

Fire and fuel managers would benefit greatly from remote sensing methods to quantify fuels loads, one of the major determinants of whether to prescribe a fire, and under what conditions. Methods that account for fuel heterogeneity are needed to do this more reliably because current operational fire and smoke models assume homogeneous fuel distributions. Although fire behavior, fire effects, and smoke emissions from fires relate to fuel structure and composition, they even more directly relate to fuel consumption. Estimation of fuel consumption requires research beyond quantification of fuel loads, whether prefire for purposes of fuel and fire planning, or postfire as a way to assess and predict fire effects. Our approach and findings advance the characterization of spatially complex shrub fuels in 3D, at the scales at which they vary using terrestrial laser scanning technology, so we can enhance the capabilities of fire and smoke models needed by managers and planners. Improved quantification of fuels and fuel consumption also will provide better, spatially explicit information to fire, fuel, and smoke managers and modelers, and policymakers.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. I examined the hypothesis that traditional social-ecological fire systems around the world include common elements of traditional fire knowledge (TFK). I defined TFK as fire-related knowledge, beliefs, and practices that have been developed and applied on specific landscapes for specific purposes by long time inhabitants. In all, 69 distinct elements of TFK were documented in 35 studies, including accounts from 27 countries on 6 continents. On all 6 continents, 21 elements (30\%) were recorded, and 46 elements (67\%) were recorded on 4 or more continents. The top 12 most commonly reported elements, which were included in {$>$} 50 \% of the studies, were fire effects on vegetation; season of the year; fire effects on animals; moisture of live or dead fuels; the onset or end of rainy season, dry season, or timing of rain; burning illegal or regulated by central government; fire intensity, heat output, i.e., hot or cool fire; frequency, return interval, time since fire; fire control; firebreaks, barriers; consequences of not burning; and plant or animal phenology. Traditional fire knowledge was multifaceted: 13 studies included more than 25 elements. Practicing traditional fire management also entails understanding the ways in which multiple elements interact and influence one another. Three classification systems provide insight into TFK systems, including typologies of agro-ecological type, pre- and postindustrial anthropological fire regimes, and viability status. The longevity of traditional fire knowledge and practice faces serious threats at precisely the time when climate change promises disruptions in fire activity that will be problematic for indigenous and nonindigenous societies alike. Central governments tend to adopt the pathological response of command and control during times of fire increase, further constraining traditional fire management. The opposite is needed: to seriously engage traditional practitioners in solving fire problems of global significance.},

Nonlinear mixed effect models (NMEM) were developed to predict total aboveground biomass as well as biomass in leaves, 1-h, 10-h, and 100 or more hour fuel classes for seven species of shrubs common to the northeastern California. Using crown area as a predictor, an allometric (power) model was used as a base model. Coefficients varied by species, component, and by a nested combination of these random effects. The results showed that NMEM that used shrub species as random effect performed better than nonlinear fixed effect models in estimating total and component biomass in shrub species used in this study. Additionally, when fixed effect models were fitted by species, not all regression parameters were statistically significant at 0.05 level of significance. NMEM were able to account for within species variation very well. The largest variation was observed in total biomass while the smallest variation was observed in the biomass in 100 or more hour fuel class. The mean prediction bias and root mean square prediction errors for total shrub biomass was 0.0409\,kg and 0.9249\,kg respectively. While there were differences between the fixed effects models and mixed effects models, the mixed effects models would be preferred to the fixed effect models for future studies involving total biomass prediction for similar shrub species and regions.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire ignition techniques have significant impact on prescribed fires' growth behavior. This paper presents a systematic way of modeling and simulating prescribed fire ignition techniques. An ignition plan specification is developed to formally specify the ignition activities and schedules of prescribed burning events. The ignition plan specification is used by ignition agents, which transform an ignition plan into detailed tasks and carry out the ignition tasks while coupling with a fire spread simulation model. Simulation results of six ignition scenarios corresponding to six basic ignition techniques are provided. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed modeling approach and show that different ignition techniques can result in different fire growth patterns for prescribed fires.},

  abstract = {Terrain plan concave and convex parts are important topographical shapes that affect the convergence and divergence of flow. The plan concavity and convexity are generally calculated through the curvature method, which is limited by the serious sensitivity to digital elevation model (DEM) errors and scale dependence. In this study, we propose an aspect vector method to quantify the terrain plan concavity and convexity. This method considers different aspect changes of the plan concavity and convexity, which reduces the scale effect on the curve bending quantification. The proposed method is applied to a mathematical Gaussian surface and two different case studies using a DEM with resolution of 5\,m. A comparative analysis is conducted between the proposed and existing curvature-based methods to assess the capability of the former. The results show that the proposed method achieves more realistic and accurate terrain plan concavity and convexity than does the existing method. Moreover, the aspect vector approach is less strongly affected by the spatial resolution of the DEM than is the existing curvature-based method, which demonstrates the application potential of the former to other studies. Furthermore, the concept of aspect vector can be expanded to quantify the terrain concavity and convexity from other directions and promote the development of existing curvature-based terrain quantification methods in geomorphometry.},

Data were collected on fire scars and also on fog drip precipitation at two sites logged in the 1850s. The sites, located on the first and third ridges inland from the Pacific Ocean, were selected to bracket the Muir Woods National Monument. The average interval between fires at the more coastal site was 27 years and at the inland site, 22 years. The difference is attributed to varying fire hazards related to a summer fog gradient. Frequency distributions of fire intervals for both sites were highly skewed toward shorter intervals. Skewed distributions indicated a natural pattern of several short intervals followed by one or more long intervals. Prescribed burning treatments should initially be repeated at less than average fire intervals and then at lengthened intervals to recreate natural fire regimes in the coast redwood forest ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been applied in wildfire science and management since the 1990s, with early applications including neural networks and expert systems. Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods \textemdash{} including deep learning and agent-based learning \textemdash{} in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.},

The aim of this study was to verify the suitability of a mixture of two- and three-component Weibull and gamma models for describing irregular and multimodal DBH distributions. Investigations were carried out in natural Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L. stands, representing the growing-up stage, in the \'Swi\k{e}tokrzyski National Park (Central Poland) and in the Pieniny National Park (Southern Poland). Sample plots (0.25\textendash 0.5 ha in area) were selected from a database used for forest dynamics analysis. The parameters of the mixture model were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and a combination of an expectation\textendash maximisation (EM) algorithm with a Newton-type (NT) method. The multistart method (MM) of choosing initial values was used. The DBH distributions in mixed Abies\textendash Fagus forests of complex structure were accurately approximated by two- and three-component mixture models. The root mean square error (RMSE) values varied from 3.4515 to 7.6682 for the Weibull mixture and from 3.6457 to 7.1419 for the gamma mixture. The results indicated that the mixture Weibull and gamma models were, in general, equally suitable for modelling irregular and multimodal DBH distributions. Finite mixture models may be used to characterise tree structural diversity, especially in uneven-aged stands of complex structure.},

  abstract = {The most destructive wildland fires occur in mixtures of living and dead vegetation, yet very little attention has been given to the fundamental differences between factors that control their flammability. Historically, moisture content has been used to evaluate the relative flammability of live and dead fuels without considering major, unreported differences in the factors that control their variations across seasons and years. Physiological changes at both the leaf and whole plant level have the potential to explain ignition and fire behavior phenomena in live fuels that have been poorly explained for decades. Here, we explore how these physiological changes violate long-held assumptions about live fuel dynamics and we present a conceptual model that describes how plant carbon and water cycles independently and interactively influence plant flammability characteristics at both the leaf and whole plant scale. This new ecophysiology-based approach can help us expand our understanding of potential plant responses to environmental change and how those physiological changes may impact plant flammability. Furthermore, it may ultimately help us better manage wildland fires in an uncertain future.},

  abstract = {A legacy of past fires is evident in the form of blackened basal hollows found throughout the southern range of the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) forest. A deeper look reveals cambial scars dating back centuries, telling a story of low- to moderate-intensity fires that burned periodically across California's Central Coast bioregion. While attempts have been made to reconstruct the fire history of this forest type, estimates of the fire-return interval vary widely, and the relationship of the fire-return interval to varying cultural influences is not fully understood. We analyzed 373 fire scars from 70 cross-sections removed from stumps, downed logs, and live trees in the coastal Santa Cruz Mountains of California, USA, in order to estimate fire-return intervals (FRI) for individual trees, mean FRI across samples, and seasonality of historical fires. The mean FRI, averaged across point samples, was 60.6 yr with a median of 40.1 yr. Fire scars were most prevalent in the dormant and latewood portions of annual growth rings. A sub-sample of 19 cross-sections, for which we were able to determine approximate fire years, exhibited a high degree of variation between samples with individual tree FRIs ranging from 10.4 yr to 128 yr. The mean FRI of 43.3 yr was marginally higher for the pre-settlement period (1352 to 1849) compared to 30.7 yr for the settlement period (1850 to 1924) and 32.3 yr for the recent period (1925 to 2013). While our results suggest a longer estimate of fire-return intervals than previously documented for this forest type, high variation within and between samples clouded distinctions and illustrates a culturally constructed fire regime characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in stand-replacing wildfires in historically frequent-fire dry forests is due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management activities including fire suppression, logging, and grazing, combined with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin+burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin+burn treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.},

Overall model discrimination was generally strong, but performance varied considerably among species and sites. The model tended to have higher sensitivity (proportion of correctly classified dead trees) and lower specificity (proportion of correctly classified live trees) for many species, indicating an overestimation of mortality. Variation in model accuracy (percentage of live and dead trees correctly classified) among species was not related to sample size or percentage observed mortality. However, we observed a positive relationship between specificity and a species-specific bark thickness multiplier, indicating that overestimation was more common in thin-barked species. Accuracy was also quite low for thinner bark classes ({$<$}1cm) for many species, leading to poorer model performance. Our results indicate that a common post-fire mortality model generally performs well across a range of species and sites; however, some thin-barked species and size classes would benefit from further refinement to improve model specificity.},

Our study quantified some physical properties of fuel particles (e.g. squared quadratic mean diameter, proportion of non-cylindrical particles) and surface fuel loading with planar intercept and plot-based methods in 10 mechanically masticated sites in northern California and south-western Oregon. Total woody fuel load differed among masticated sites, ranging from 15.3 to 63.4 Mg ha\textendash 1, with the majority of the load concentrated in the 10-h (53.7\%) and 1-h (29.2\%) time-lag classes. Masticated fuels were densely packed, with total depths ranging from 4.6 to 8.0 cm and fuelbed bulk densities ranging from 45.9 to 115.3 kg m\textendash 3. To accurately quantify loading in masticated fuelbeds, we recommend using a hybrid methodology, where 1-h and 10-h fuel loadings are estimated using a plot-based method and 100-h and 1000-h fuel loadings are estimated using the standard planar intercept method. Most masticated fuelbeds differed in loading by fuel class and fuelbed depth, when compared with existing natural and slash-based fuelbeds, suggesting new fire behavior fuel models specific to masticated fuelbeds may be warranted.},

A portion of the spatial variation in dead surface fuel moisture of woodland and forest ecosystems is likely attributed to differences in stand conditions (i.e. stand density and composition). Existing evidence suggests that the role of stand conditions on dead surface fuel moisture is inconsistent across studies and more research examining the effects of stand conditions on seasonal microclimate and fuel moisture is needed. This study examined the effects of different stand conditions within Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) woodlands and forests, including intact oak-dominated stands without Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), oak stands that have been invaded by Douglas-fir (encroached), and thinned stands with Douglas-fir removed within Oregon white oak ecosystems of northern California on seasonal variation of microclimate and dead surface fuel moisture. Stand condition had a strong effect on microclimate and fuel moisture over time with thinned stands consistently having warmer and drier conditions with lower fuel moisture than encroached stands in most surface fuel components. Differences in fuel moisture among stand conditions were most pronounced in the late spring and early fall. Observed fuel moisture values did not correlate well with estimates from remotely automated weather stations or process-based calculations, especially when observed fuel moisture values exceeded 20\%. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that stand conditions can modify microclimate that contributes to variation in dead surface fuel moisture within Oregon white oak ecosystems of northern California. These differences are often not considered within commonly used fuel moisture estimates, emphasizing the need to develop better models and tools to allow managers to more accurately anticipate fuel moisture conditions in varying stands to model landscape variation in fire behavior and effects and to meet fuel reduction and restoration objectives.},

In this project, we evaluated two methods of mapping burn severity in the context of rapid post-fire assessment for four wildfires in western Montana using 64 plots as field reference: (1) an image-based burn severity mapping approach using the Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio, and (2) a fire effects simulation approach using the FIREHARM model. The image-based approach was moderately correlated with percentage tree mortality but had no relationship with percentage fuel consumption, whereas the simulation approach was moderately correlated with percentage fuel consumption and weakly correlated with percentage tree mortality. Burn severity maps produced by the two approaches had mixed results among the four sampled wildfires. Both approaches had the same overall map agreement when compared with a sampled composite burn index but the approaches generated different severity maps. Though there are limitations to both approaches and more research is needed to refine methodologies, these techniques have the potential to be used synergistically to improve burn severity mapping capabilities of land managers, enabling them to quickly and effectively meet rehabilitation objectives.},

Wildfire simulation models are an important research tool that help further our understanding of fire behaviour and can allow experimentation without recourse to live fires. Current fire simulation models fit into two general categories: empirical models and physical models. We present a new modelling approach that uses agent-based modelling to combine the complexity possible with physical models with the ease of computation of empirical models. Our model represents the fire front as a set of moving agents that respond to, and interact with, vegetation, wind, and terrain. We calibrate the model using two simulated fires and one real fire and validate the model against another real fire and the interim behaviour of the real calibration fire. Our model successfully replicates these fires, with a figure of merit on par with simulations by the Prometheus simulation model. Our model is a stepping-stone in using agent-based modelling for fire behaviour simulation, as we demonstrate the ability of agent-based modelling to replicate fire behaviour through emergence alone.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

As an illustration of the benefits that may arise from including physiological processes in models of fire-caused tree mortality, we develop a testable, biophysical hypothesis for explaining pervasive patterns in conifer injury and functional impairment in response to fires. We use a plume model to estimate vapor pressure deficits (D) in tree canopies during surface fires and show that D are sufficiently high to cause embolism in canopy branches. The potential implications of plume conditions and tree response are discussed.},

In this study, we compared various modifications of three common sampling methods (planar intercept, fixed-area microplot and photoload) for estimating fine woody surface fuel components (1-, 10-, 100-h fuels) using artificial fuelbeds of known fuel loadings as reference. Two modifications of the sampling methods were used: (1) measuring diameters only and both diameters and lengths and (2) measuring diameters to (a) the nearest 1.0 mm, (b) traditional size classes (1 h = 0\textendash 6 mm, 10 h = 6\textendash 25 mm, 100 h = 25\textendash 76 mm), (c) 1-cm diameter classes and (d) 2-cm classes. We statistically compared differences in sampled biomass values to the reference loading and found that (1) fixed-area microplot techniques were slightly more accurate than the others, (2) the most accurate loading estimates were when fuel particle diameters were measured and not estimated to a diameter class, (3) measuring particle lengths did not improve estimation accuracy, (4) photoload methods performed poorly under high fuel loads and (5) accurate estimate of fuel biomass requires intensive sampling for both planar intercept and fixed-area microplot methods.},

This complexity makes it difficult to accurately describe, classify, sample and map fuels for wildland fire research and management. As a result, many fire behaviour and effects software prediction systems use a generalised description of fuels to simplify data collection and entry into various computer programs. There are several major fuel description systems currently used in the United States, Canada and Australia, and this is a source of confusion for many in fire management. This paper (1) summarises the challenges of describing fuels, (2) contrasts approaches (association, classification and abstraction) for developing fuel description systems and (3) discusses possible future directions in wildland fuel description and science to transition to a universal fuel description system. Most discussion centres on surface fuel loadings as the primary descriptive characteristic.

Presented here is a comprehensive research effort to evaluate six indirect sampling techniques for estimating CBD. As reference data, detailed crown fuel biomass measurements were taken on each tree within fixed-area plots located in five important conifers types in the western United States, using destructive sampling following a series of four sampling stages to measure the vertical and horizontal distribution of canopy biomass. The six ground-based indirect measurement techniques used these instruments: LI-COR LAI-2000, AccuPAR ceptometer, CID digital plant canopy imager, hemispherical photography, spherical densiometer, and point sampling. These techniques were compared with four aggregations of crown biomass to compute CBD: foliage only, foliage and small branchwood, foliage and all branchwood (no stems), and all canopy biomass components. Most techniques had the best performance when all canopy biomass components except stems were used. Performance dropped only slightly when the foliage and small branchwood canopy biomass aggregation (best approximates fuels available for crown fires) was employed. The LAI-2000, hemispherical photography, and CID plant canopy imager performed best. Regression equations that predict CBD from gap fraction are presented for all six techniques.},

We then compared FIA sampled loadings to the keyed class loading values for four surface fuel components (duff, litter, fine woody debris, coarse woody debris) and to mapped FLM, FCCS, and FTG class loading values from spatial fuel products. We found poor performances (R2{$<$}0.30) for most fuel component loadings in all three classifications that, in turn, contributed to poor mapping accuracies. The main reason for the poor performances is the high variability of the four fuel component loadings within classification categories and the inherent scale of this variability does not seem to match the FIA measurement scale or LANDFIRE mapping scale.},

This paper first presents the challenges of mapping fuels: canopy concealment, fuelbed complexity, fuel type diversity, fuel variability, and fuel model generalization. Then, four approaches to mapping fuels are discussed with examples provided from the literature: (1) field reconnaissance; (2) direct mapping methods; (3) indirect mapping methods; and (4) gradient modeling. A fuel mapping method is proposed that uses current remote sensing and image processing technology. Future fuel mapping needs are also discussed which include better field data and fuel models, accurate GIS reference layers, improved satellite imagery, and comprehensive ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Wildland fuels are important to fire managers because they can be manipulated to achieve management goals, such as restoring ecosystems, decreasing fire intensity, minimizing plant mortality, and reducing erosion. However, it is difficult to accurately measure, describe, and map wildland fuels because of the great variability of wildland fuelbed properties over space and time. Few have quantified the scale of this variability across space to understand its effect on fire spread, burning intensity, and ecological effects. This study investigated the spatial variability of loading (biomass) across major surface and canopy fuel components in low elevation northern Rocky Mountain forest and rangeland ecosystems to determine the inherent scale of surface fuel and canopy fuel distributions. Biomass loadings (kg~m-2) were measured for seven surface fuel components\textemdash four downed dead woody fuel size classes (0\textendash 6~mm, 6\textendash 25~mm, 25\textendash 75~mm, and 75~+~mm), duff plus litter, shrub, and herb\textemdash using a spatially nested plot sampling design within a 1~km2 square sampling grid installed at six sites in the northern US Rocky Mountains. Bulk density, biomass, and cover of the forest canopy were also measured for each plot in the grid. Surface fuel loadings were estimated using a combination of photoload and destructive collection methods at many distances within the grid. We quantified spatial variability of fuel component loading using spatial variograms, and found that each fuel component had its own inherent scale with fine fuels varying at scales of 1\textendash 5~m, coarse fuels at 10\textendash 150~m, and canopy fuels from 100 to 500~m. Using regression analyses, we computed a scaling factor of 4.6~m for fuel particle diameter (4.6~m increase in scale with each cm increase in particle diameter). Findings from this study can be used to design fuel sampling projects, classify fuelbeds, and map fuel characteristics, such as loading, to account for the inherent scale of fuel distributions to get more accurate fuel loading estimations.},

  abstract = {Four regions of the world share a similar climate and structurally similar plant communities with the Mediterranean Basin. These five areas, known collectively as "mediterranean-type climate (MTC) regions", are dominated by evergreen sclerophyllous-leaved shrublands, semi-deciduous scrub, and woodlands, all of which are prone to widespread crown fires. Summer droughts produce an annual fire hazard that contributes to a highly predictable fire regime. Fire has been an important factor driving the convergence of these systems and is reflected in plant traits such as lignotubers in resprouting shrubs and delayed reproduction that restricts recruitment to a postfire pulse of seedlings. On fertile soils where postfire resprouting is very rapid, opportunities for postfire seedling recruitment are limited and thus these woody taxa have not opted for delaying reproduction. Such fire-independent recruitment is widespread in the floras of MTC regions of the Mediterranean Basin and California and postfire seeding tends to dominate at the more arid end of the gradient. Due to very different geological histories in South Africa and Western Australia, substrates are nutrient poor and thus postfire resprouters do not pose a similar competitive challenge to seedlings and thus postfire seeding is very widespread in these floras. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that the MTC region of Chile had fire-prone landscapes in the Tertiary, these were lost with the late Miocene completion of the Andean uplift, which now blocks summer lightning storms from moving into the region. Today these five regions pose a significant fire management challenge due to the annual fire hazard and metropolitan centers juxtaposed with highly flammable vegetation. This challenge varies across the five MTC landscapes as a function of differences in regional fuel loads and population density.},

  abstract = {Aim Native American burning impacts on California shrubland dominated landscapes are evaluated relative to the natural lightning fire potential for affecting landscape patterns. Location Focus was on the coastal ranges of central and southern California. Methods Potential patterns of Indian burning were evaluated based upon historical documents, ethnographic accounts, archaeological records and consideration of contemporary land management tactics. Patterns of vegetation distribution in this region were evaluated relative to environmental factors and the resilience of the dominant shrub vegetation to different fire frequencies. Results Lightning fire frequency in this region is one of the lowest in North America and the density of pre-Columbian populations was one of the highest. Shrublands dominate the landscape throughout most of the region. These woody communities have weak resilience to high fire frequency and are readily displaced by annual grasses and forbs under high fire frequency. Intact shrublands provided limited resources for native Americans and thus there was ample motivation for using fire to degrade this vegetation to an open mosaic of shrubland/grassland, not unlike the agropastoral modification of ecologically related shrublands by Holocene peoples in the Mediterranean Basin. Alien-dominated grasslands currently cover approximately one-quarter of the landscape and less than 1\% of these grasslands have a significant native grass presence. Ecological studies in the Californian coastal ranges have failed to uncover any clear soil or climate factors explaining grassland and shrubland distribution patterns. Main conclusions Coastal ranges of California were regions of high Indian density and low frequency of lightning fires. The natural vegetation dominants on this landscape are shrubland vegetation that often form dense impenetrable stands with limited resources for Native Americans. Natural fire frequencies are not high enough to maintain these landscapes in habitable mixtures of shrublands and grasslands but such landscape mosaics are readily produced with additional human subsidy of ignitions. It is hypothesized that a substantial fraction of the landscape was type converted from shrubland to grassland and much of the landscape that underwent such type conversion has either been maintained by Euro-American land management practices or resisted recolonization of native shrublands. It appears that these patterns are disturbance dependent and result from anthropogenic alteration of landscapes initiated by Native Americans and sustained and expanded upon by Euro-American settlers.},

The compactness of these fuelbeds is thought to moderate fire behaviour, but whether standard fuel models can accurately predict fire behaviour and effects is poorly understood. Prescribed burns were conducted in young ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests at two sites in northern California where the midstorey layer dominated by shrubs had been masticated. Surface fuels were raked from the base of a subset of trees before burning. Rate of spread and flame length were estimated for both backing and heading fires, soil heating measured with thermocouples and tree fire injury recorded. Standard fuel models often over-predicted rate of spread or under-predicted flame length. Custom models generally provided a better balance between the slow rates of spread and moderate flame lengths observed in prescribed burns. Post-fire tree mortality was most strongly associated with crown scorch and tree size; raking fuels from the base of trees did not improve survival. Under severe fire weather conditions, fire behaviour and effect models as well as observations from wildfires suggest that mastication may be more effective for moderating fire behaviour than reducing residual tree mortality. Treating masticated fuels with prescribed burns could potentially improve the resilience of stands to wildfire.},

Extent of forest change and effect on understory vegetation over time are not well understood, but such information is useful to forest management focused on restoring biodiversity and resilience to these ecosystems. We re-measured three large (4ha) historical ``Methods of Cutting'' (MC) plots in mixed-conifer forest of the central Sierra Nevada installed in 1929 to evaluate the effects of different logging methods. Trees {$\geqslant$}10cm were surveyed across the entire plots and understory vegetation (tree seedlings, shrubs, and herbaceous species) was quantified within quadrats in the old-growth condition in 1929 prior to logging, later in 1929 after logging, and again in 2007 or 2008. We also compared forest structure in the MC plots with an adjacent unlogged ``control'' area and collected fire scar samples from nearby stumps to evaluate the historical fire regime. The contemporary tree density in the MC plots (739treesha-1) was 2.4times greater than the 1929 pre-logging density (314treesha-1). Trees in the small and intermediate size classes (10\textendash 75cmdbh) were significantly over-represented, and trees in the larger size classes ({$>$}90cmdbh) generally significantly under-represented, compared with historical conditions. The proportion of pine dropped from 37\% of tree basal area in 1929 to 21\% in 2007/08. Density of small to intermediate sized trees was similar in the contemporary logged and unlogged control plots, suggesting that over the long term, ingrowth may have been influenced more by lack of fire than historical logging. Change to non-tree vegetation was most pronounced for shrub cover, which averaged 28.6\% in 1929 but only 2.5\% in 2008. CART analysis indicated that the highest shrub cover in 1929 was in areas having four or fewer trees growing within 15m to the south of the quadrat, suggesting that reduced light was the most likely explanation for the decline over time. Herbaceous species richness in 2008 was significantly lower than in 1931, two years after logging, but did not differ significantly from 1929, prior to logging. Understory vegetation should benefit from thinning or prescribed fire treatments that lead to a greater abundance of higher light environments within stands.},

Frequent fire creates fine-scale variability in forest structure, which may then interrupt fuel continuity and prevent future fires from killing overstorey trees. Testing the generality and scale of this phenomenon is challenging for vast, long-lived forest ecosystems. We quantify forest structural variability and fire severity across {$>$}30 years and {$>$}1000 wildfires in California's Sierra Nevada. We find that greater variability in forest structure increases resilience by reducing rates of fire-induced tree mortality and that the scale of this effect is local, manifesting at the smallest spatial extent of forest structure tested (90 \texttimes{} 90 m). Resilience of these forests is likely compromised by structural homogenisation from a century of fire suppression, but could be restored with management that increases forest structural variability.},

Providing all of a tree's photosynthetic capacity, branches represent an increasing proportion of total aboveground wood production as trees enlarge. To examine branch development and its effects on wood volume growth, we dissected 31 branches from eight Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl. and seven Sequoiadendron giganteum Lindl. trees. The cambium-area-to-leaf-area ratio was maintained with size and age but increased with light availability, whereas the heartwood-deposition-area-to-leaf-area ratio increased with size and age but was insensitive to light availability. The proportion of foliage mass arrayed in \&lt;1-cm-diameter epicormic shoots increased with decreasing light and was higher in Sequoia (20\textendash 60\%) than in Sequoiadendron (3\textendash 16\%). Well-illuminated branches concentrated leaves higher and distally, while shaded branches distributed leaves lower and proximally. In similar light environments, older branches distributed leaves lower and more proximally than younger branches. Branch size, light, species, heartwood area, a heartwood-area\textendash species interaction, and ovulate cone mass predicted 87.5\% of the variability in wood volume growth of branches. After accounting for the positive effects of size and light, wood volume growth declined with heartwood area and age. The effect of age was trivial compared to the effect of heartwood area, suggesting that heartwood expansion caused the age-related decline in wood volume growth. Additionally, Sequoiadendron branches of similar size and light environment with more ovulate cones produced less wood, even though these cones were long-lived and photosynthetic, reflecting the energetic cost of seed production. These results contributed to a conceptual model of branch development in which light availability, injury, heartwood content, gravity, and time interact to produce the high degree of branch structural variation evident within redwood crowns.},

This study quantified forest fuels of the montane zone of Boulder County, CO, USA in an effort to aid wildfire mitigation planning and provide a metric by which LANDFIRE national fuel maps may be compared. Using data from 196 randomly stratified field plots, pre-existing vegetation maps, and derived variables, predictive classification and regression tree models were created for four fuel parameters necessary for spatial fire simulation with FARSITE (surface fuel model, canopy bulk density, canopy base height, and stand height). These predictive models accounted for 56\textendash 62\% of the variability in forest fuels and produced fuel maps that predicted 91.4\% and 88.2\% of the burned area of two historic fires simulated in the FARSITE model. Simulations of areas burned based on LANDFIRE national fuel maps were less accurate, burning 77.7\% and 40.3\% of the historic fire areas.

Recent fires burning in masticated fuels have behaved in unexpected and contradictory ways, likely because the shredded, compact fuel created when trees and shrubs are masticated contains irregularly shaped pieces in mixtures quite different from other woody fuels. We review fuels characteristics and fire behavior in masticated fuels across the United States. With insights from the few laboratory and field burning experiments conducted, we highlight the variation likely to occur across different ecosystems in which these treatments are being widely implemented. Masticated debris has a propensity to flame and smolder for long durations. Fuel variability and vegetation response will likely influence whether or not treatments reduce long-term fire hazard. We identify key science needs that will better elucidate fire behavior and effects in these treatments. With mastication widely applied in an expanding wildland\textendash urban interface it is crucial to understand how such fuels burn. What we learn about combustion in these fuels will inform effective fuels management in these and other mixed fuels.},

The introduction of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen recognized as causing Sudden Oak Death (SOD), leads to rapid decline and mortality of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) in forests of coastal California, USA. We tracked foliar moisture content (FMC) of uninfected tanoaks, SOD-infected tanoaks, SOD-killed (dead) tanoaks, and surface litter for 12 months. We found that FMC values differed significantly among the three categories of infection. FMC of uninfected tanoaks averaged 82.3\% for the year whereas FMC of infected tanoaks had a lower average of 77.8\% (ANOVA, P=0.04). Dead trees had a significantly lower FMC, averaging 12.3\% (ANOVA, P{$<$}0.01) for the year. During fire season (June\textendash September), dead tanoak FMC reached a low of 5.8\%, with no significant difference between dead canopy fuels and surface litter (ANOVA, P=0.44). Application of low FMC values to a crown ignition model results in extremely high canopy base height values to escape crown ignition. Remote estimation of dead FMC using 10-h timelag fuel moisture shows a strong correlation between remote automated weather station (RAWS) 10-h timelag fuel moisture data and the FMC of dead leaves (R2=0.78, P{$<$}0.01). Results from this study will help refine the decision support tools for fire managers in SOD-affected areas as well as conditions in other forests where diseases and insect epidemics have altered forest canopy fuels.},

  abstract = {Restoring characteristic fire regimes and forest structures are central objectives of many restoration and fuel reduction projects. Within-stand spatial pattern is a fundamental attribute of forest structure and influences many ecological processes and ecosystem functions. In this review we synthesize the available spatial reference information for fire-frequent pine and mixed-conifer forests in western North America; interpret this information in the context of restoration and fuel reduction treatment design; and identify areas for future research, including recommended approaches for quantifying within-stand tree spatial patterns. We identified 50 studies of tree spatial patterns in fire-frequent pine and mixed conifer forests, 25 of which documented spatial reference conditions. The characteristic structure of fire-frequent forests is a mosaic of three elements: openings, single trees, and clumps of trees with adjacent or interlocking crowns. This mosaic structure typically manifests at scales {$<$}0.4ha, but sometimes extends to scales as large as 4ha, particularly on sites with fire regimes that include both low- and moderate-severity fires. We documented preferential use of global pattern analysis techniques (90\% of analyses) relative to local analysis techniques (10\% of analyses). Ripley's K statistic, an example of global spatial pattern analysis, was the most frequently used analytic technique (38\% of analyses). These findings are important because global pattern analysis does not explicitly quantify spatial heterogeneity within a pattern, the very thing spatial reference studies seek to characterize and one of the core structural attributes treatments aim to restore. Based on these findings, we encourage managers to consciously adopt a view of forest structure that accommodates spatial heterogeneity within forest stands, and to use this conceptualization of forest structure to guide prescription development. Restoration prescriptions and marking guidelines that explicitly incorporate within-stand spatial heterogeneity\textemdash such as by specifying the numbers and sizes of openings and tree clumps, and the number of widely-spaced single trees to retain per unit area\textemdash will improve the likelihood of restoring characteristic forest structures and the ecological processes such structures support. We infer that the near-exclusive use of global pattern analysis has limited the quantity and usability of spatial reference information available to managers, has also likely limited the development and testing of novel ecological hypotheses about pattern-generating mechanisms. Consequently, we recommend that forest scientists change how they quantify tree spatial patterns by complimenting the traditional global analysis methods with local pattern analysis techniques, which quantify spatial heterogeneity within a study area.},

  abstract = {Fire plays a central role in determining structure, composition, and recruitment in many forest types. In coast redwood forests, the role of fire is not well understood and scant literature exists on post-fire response, particularly in the southern part of the range. In order to better understand patterns of survival and recruitment following fire for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [lamb. ex D. Don] Endl.) and associated tree species, three sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA, were sampled following wildfire. Randomly selected 10 m diameter plots were used to collect data on survivorship and post fire regeneration in order to analyze short-term responses including mortality, crown retention, basal sprouting, canopy regeneration, and seedling production. Results indicated that coast redwood had the lowest percent mortality (11.98 \%) and highest mean canopy retention (43.10 \%) of all species sampled, followed by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) (25.54 \%), tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus [Hook. \& Arn.] Manos) (23.27 \%), combined oak species (Quercus sp.) (6.67 \%), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh) (4.13 \%). In addition, associated species experienced higher survival rates when proximate to coast redwoods. Coast redwood trees also exhibited the highest canopy regeneration (53 \%), the highest average density of basal sprouts (3.54 \texttimes{} 104 ha), and the greatest average number of seedlings, ranging from zero to 2.09 \texttimes{} 105 seedlings ha-1. Overall, coast redwood appeared to have a balance of fire adaptive features, exceeding all associated species, which allow individual trees to withstand fire, while at the same time promoting recruitment following fire.},

To go along with this, the core task confronted by the community now is to explore solutions aiming at the cornerstones of their 3D upgrading. In the common cases of forest structural and spatial ecology, tree spatial pattern is such a cornerstone-like theme, which is of fundamental significance on reflecting their various aspects. However, the mainstream methods of spatial point pattern analysis that are rooted in the traditional tools of forest inventory, as our review indicated, cannot directly take the advantage of LiDAR remote sensing in 3D characterization of trees. To break this bottleneck, we proposed 3D tree spatial pattern analysis, as a theoretical reconstruction from top firstly. We further proposed 3D data forms and 3D spatial statistics models to comprise a general principle framework for supporting future developments of 3D methods. These foundational outlooks at the level of transiting potential to practice are of referencing implication on, in a broader sense, boosting 3D plant spatial pattern analysis for setting the cornerstone of LiDAR advancing 3D structural and spatial ecology.},

These simulations enable exploration of the sensitivity of model results to specific aspects of the interpretation and use of the locally measured wind data from this experiment. By shifting ignition times with respect to dynamic measured tower wind data by up to 2 min, FIRETEC simulations are used to examine possible ramifications of treating the measured tower winds as if they were precisely the same as those present at the location of the fire, as well as possible implications of temporal averaging of winds or undersampling. Model results suggest that careful consideration should be paid to the relative time scales of the wind fluctuations, duration of the fires, and data collection rates when using experimentally derived winds as inputs for fire models.},

Then data collected at experimental sites near Flagstaff, Arizona are used to create a discontinuous canopy fuel representation in HIGRAD/FIRETEC. Four simulations are presented with different canopy and understory configurations as described in the text. The results are discussed in terms of the same two discrete locations within the canopy for each simulation. The canopy structure had significant effects on the balance between radiative and convective heating in driving the fire and indeed sometimes determined whether a specific tree burned or not. In our simulations the ground fuel density was the determining factor in the overall spread rate of the fire, even when the overstory was involved in the fire. This behavior is well known in the fire meteorology community. In the future, simulations of this type could help land managers to better understand the role of canopy and understory structure in determining fire behavior, and thus help them decide between the different thinning and fuel treatment strategies available to them.},

In this study, wind and fuel data collected during the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiments (RxCADRE) fire campaign were used to generate initial and boundary conditions for coupled fire-atmosphere simulations. We present a novel method to obtain fuels representation at the model grid scale using a combination of imagery, machine learning, and field sampling. Several methods to generate wind input conditions for the model from eight different anemometer measurements are explored. We find a strong sensitivity of fire outcomes to wind inputs. This result highlights the critical need to include variable wind fields as inputs in modeling marginal fire conditions. This work highlights the complexities of comparing physics-based model results against observations, which are more acute in marginal burning conditions, where stronger sensitivities to local variability in wind and fuels drive fire outcomes.},

The FIRETEC model is based on a multi-phase transport approach, and incorporates representations of the physical processes that govern wildfires, such as combustion and radiative and convective heat exchange. Results from the coupled model show that the forward spread of the simulated fires increases with increasing ambient wind speed, and the spread rates are consistent with those observed in field experiments of grass fires; however, the forward spread also depends significantly on the initial length of the fire line, and for a given ambient wind speed the spread rate for long (100 m) lines is greater than that for short (16 m) lines. The spread of the simulated fires in the lateral direction also depends on the ambient wind speed and the length of the fire line, and a possible explanation for this effect is given. For weak ambient winds, the shape of the fire perimeter is dramatically different from that seen with higher wind speeds. The shape of the fire perimeter is also shown to depend on the initial length of the fire line. These differences in fire behavior are attributed to the differences in the nature of the coupled atmosphere\textendash fire interactions among these cases, and are described in terms of the complex interplay between radiative and convective heat transfer.},

A three-parameter Weibull function is assumed as the component probability density function in the finite mixture model. Four example plots, each with two species, are selected to demonstrate model fitting and comparison. It appears that the finite mixture model is flexible enough to fit irregular, multimodal, or highly skewed diameter distributions. Compared with traditional methods in which a single Weibull function is fit to either the whole plot or each species component separately, the finite mixture model produces much smaller root mean square error and bias, and fits the entire distribution of the plots with extreme peaks, bimodality, or heavy-tails well. In some cases, a single Weibull function fitted to individual species separately may produce more accurate estimations for the component distributions of the two species than the finite mixture model. The summation of the two independent species results, however, may not produce a better prediction for the entire plot. This study shows that the finite mixture model is a promising alternative method for modeling the diameter distribution of multispecies mixed forest stands. For. Sci. 48(4):653\textendash 661.},

  abstract = {Improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms of tree mortality following fires is important with the predicted increase in wildfires under climate change, as well as continued use of prescribed fire for forest management. Disruption of water transport in the xylem from exposure to the heat plume of a fire has been hypothesized as a mechanism of delayed tree mortality. This heat plume rapidly increases vapor pressure deficit in the canopy, increasing transpiration and tension on the xylem causing cavitation, thus reducing water transport and leading to eventual tree death. We aimed to increase understanding of the mechanisms behind such unintended mortality by determining whether branches and roots of longleaf pine are more vulnerable to cavitation when exposed to temperatures expected to occur during prescribed or wild fires. Additionally, we modeled expected branch cavitation under fire conditions based on measured cavitation vulnerability. We heated branch and root segments in a water bath to 41 \textdegree C and 54 \textdegree C and simulated the negative xylem water potentials experienced during exposure to a heat plume using a double-ended pressure chamber. When branches and roots were pressurized under elevated temperatures, xylem in both organs was more vulnerable to cavitation. In branches, as temperature was increased from 23 \textdegree C\textendash 54 \textdegree C, the pressure at which 50\% conductivity was lost (P50) increased from -3.55 MPa to -2.79 MPa, while in roots, P50 increased from -2.08 MPa to -1.36 MPa. When the P50 values measured under elevated temperatures were included in plume and hydraulic models, branches were predicted to experience conditions leading to 50\% loss of conductivity up to two meters higher into the canopy than under ambient temperatures. Overall, these results suggest that heating of branches and roots during fires can increase vulnerability to xylem cavitation, potentially leading to hydraulic disruption and delayed tree mortality.},

  abstract = {Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), a western North American conifer of ancient lineage, has a paradoxical combination of late-successional characteristics and strong adaptations to disturbance. Despite its shade tolerance and heavy dominance of the canopy on many sites, redwood saplings are uncommon in upland old-growth stands. Information needed to ensure the conservation of old-growth redwood forests has been limited. In this review paper, we integrate evidence on redwood biology with data on the historic and modern disturbance regimes to help clarify the degree to which key attributes of redwood forests may have been dependent upon periodic disturbance. Available evidence suggests that episodes of fire, flooding, and slope failure prior to European settlement were frequent but predominantly of low to moderate severity and extent, resulting in broadly uneven-aged forests. The majority of fires prior to European settlement were apparently of human origin. Frequency and severity of the major disturbance agents have been radically changed in modern times. Fires have been largely excluded, and flooding has been altered in ways that have often been detrimental to old-growth redwoods on alluvial terraces. However, because of the apparent anthropogenic origin of most presettlement fires, the long-term evolutionary role of fire for coast redwood is ecologically ambiguous. With fire exclusion, redwood possibly could be displaced to some extent on upland sites by increasing abundance of fire-sensitive competitors. Alternatively, redwood may be able to maintain dominance by vegetative sprouting and new seedling establishment on root-wad mounds, fallen logs, and on soil exposed by slope failure. Future research priorities are suggested that will help resolve some of the current ambiguities.},

We used ensemble classification and regression trees to examine the relationships between fuel characteristics and fire temperature dynamics. Fire behaviour was best predicted by characterising fuelbed heterogeneity and continuity across multiple plots of similar fire intensity, where impacts from plot-to-plot variation in fuel, fire and weather did not overwhelm the effects of fuels. The individual plot-level results revealed the significance of specific fuel types (e.g. bare soil, pine leaf litter) as well as the spatial configuration of fire. This was the first known study to link the importance of fuelbed continuity and the heterogeneity associated with fuel types to fire behaviour at metre to submetre scales and provides the next step in understanding the complex responses of vegetation to fire behaviour.},

Often, the reason fire monitoring projects are not implemented is because fire management agencies do not have scientifically based, standardized protocols for inventorying pre- and postfire conditions that satisfy their monitoring and management objectives. We have developed a comprehensive system, called the Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System (FIREMON), which is designed to satisfy fire management agencies' monitoring and inventory requirements for most ecosystems, fuel types, and geographic areas in the United States. FIREMON consists of standardized sampling methods and manuals, field forms, database, analysis program, and an image analysis guide so that fire managers can 1) design a fire effects monitoring project, 2) collect and store the sampled data, 3) statistically analyze and summarize the data, 4) link the data with satellite imagery, and 5) map the sampled data across the landscape using image processing. FIREMON allows flexible but comprehensive sampling of fire effects so data can be evaluated for significant impacts, shared across agencies, and used to update and refine fire management plans and prescriptions. FIREMON has a flexible structure that allows the modification of sampling methods and local code fields to allow the sampling of locally important fire effects evaluation criteria.},

  abstract = {Abstract FOFEM (a First Order Fire Effects Model) is a computer program for predicting tree mortality, fuel consumption, smoke production, and soil heating caused by prescribed fire or wildfire. Purpose First order fire effects are those that concern the direct or indirect or immediate consequences of fire. First order fire effects form an important basis for prediction secondary effects such as tree regeneration plant succession, and changes in site productivity, but these long-term effects generally involve interaction with many variables (for example,, weather, animal use, insects, and disease) and are not predicted by this program. Currently, FOFEM provides quantitative fire effects information for tree mortality, fuel consumption mineral soil exposure, smoke, and soil heating. Estimated emissions are included for CO2, CO, CH4, SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10. Restrictions and Limitations FOFEM is a point model which means that it predicts fuel consumption and smoke emissions for a point on the landscape/stand (about 1-5 m2). The extrapolation of that point measurement upwards in scale is at the discretion of the user. Fuel and moisture conditions across a stand and landscape are notoriously variable so one point estimate for large areas can introduce bias into the predictions. The appropriate scaling up of FOFEM predictions is the most important consideration in using the model. Another important consideration is the accurate measurement of the inputs that go into FOFEM, namely fuel loadings and fuel moistures. The more accurate the measurements are, the more realistic the predictions. Users should also keep in mind that the default values provided in FOFEM are based on literature but may not accurately reflect local conditions. Areas where fire effects research is limited or where fires are infrequent may be particularly subject to error},

The resulting 21 fuel classes are called Fuel Loading Models and classified the study dataset with an \textasciitilde 34\% misclassification rate. The classification can be used to describe fuel loadings for a plot or stand, or as map units for mapping fuel loadings across large regions.

  abstract = {Although knowledge of surface fuel loads is critical for evaluating potential fire behaviour and effects, their inherent variability makes these difficult to quantify. Several studies relate fuel loads to vegetation type, topography and spectral imaging, but little work has been done examining relationships between forest overstorey variables and surface fuel characteristics on a small scale ({$<$}0.05 ha). Within-stand differences in structure and composition would be expected to influence fuel bed characteristics, and thus affect fire behaviour and effects. We used intensive tree and fuel measurements in a fire-excluded Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest to assess relationships and build predictive models for loads of duff, litter and four size classes of downed woody fuels to overstorey structure and composition. Overstorey variables explained a significant but somewhat small percentage of variation in fuel load, with marginal R2 values for predictive models ranging from 0.16 to 0.29. Canopy cover was a relatively important predictor for all fuel components, although relationships varied with tree species. White fir abundance had a positive relationship with total fine woody fuel load. Greater pine abundance was associated with lower load of fine woody fuels and greater load of litter. Duff load was positively associated with total basal area and negatively associated with oak abundance. Knowledge of relationships contributing to within-stand variation in fuel loads can increase our understanding of fuel accumulation and improve our ability to anticipate fine-scale variability in fire behaviour and effects in heterogeneous mixed species stands.},

Previous research on modeling plant ecologies has focused on representations to handle this complexity, mostly through geometric simplifications, such as points or billboards. In this paper we describe a multi-scale method to design large-scale ecosystems with individual plants that are realistically modeled and faithfully capture biological features, such as growth, plant interactions, different types of tropism, and the competition for resources. Our approach is based on leveraging inter- and intra-plant self-similarities for efficiently modeling plant geometry. We focus on the interactive design of plant ecosystems of up to 500K plants, while adhering to biological priors known in forestry and botany research. The introduced parameter space supports modeling properties of nine distinct plant ecologies while each plant is represented as a 3D surface mesh. The capabilities of our framework are illustrated through numerous models of forests, individual plants, and validations.},

The specific objectives of the study were (1) to examine the use of different dependent and independent variables in the canonical correlation analysis of MSN, and (2) to examine the influence of reduced number of training data plots by means of simulations. The reliability of the constructed diameter distributions was analysed using error indices and the accuracy of stand attributes derived from predicted diameter distributions. The study material included a total of 201 plots and they were reduced to 181, 161, \ldots{} , 41 plots in the simulations. The results indicated that when selecting dependent variables in the canonical correlation analysis it is sufficient to have variables reflecting stand means and aggregated variables (sums) to obtain accurate predictions of diameter distributions. Furthermore, the prediction models should not to be too detailed, i.e. they should not include a great number of independent variables since cross-validation always tends to give too optimistic results. Validation on independent data will often show considerably poorer reliability figures. Finally, the results indicated that even such a low number of training plots as about 100 can produce accurate enough predictions of stand attributes and diameter distributions.},

  abstract = {Computational models of wildfires are an important tool for fire managers and scientists. However, fuel inputs to wildfire models can be difficult to represent with sufficient detail to be both computationally efficient and representative of observations. Recent advances in fuel mapping with airborne and terrestrial laser scanning (LIDAR) techniques present new opportunities to capture variation in fuels within a tree canopy and on a landscape. In this paper, we develop a technique for building 3D representations of vegetation from point clouds created by Terrestrial Laser Scans (TLS). Our voxel based approach can be extended to represent heterogeneous crown fuels as collections of fuel cells in modern 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics wildfire models such as FDS, QUIC-Fire, or FIRETEC. We evaluated the effectiveness of our technique at different fuel cell resolutions by using the DAKOTA optimization toolkit to compare simulated fire behavior in FDS with observed burn data collected during a series of experiments at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory. The primary finding was that within the search space of point cloud derived fuel cells, we find accurate descriptions of observed fire behavior with the FDS model. We also find that within our search space, regions of global minima are consistent across fuel cells at different resolutions. This finding suggests that while new techniques are capable of characterizing fuel models with a high degree of fidelity, high resolution 3D fuel models do not improve parity with observed fire behavior in the FDS fire model. The results of this paper offer fire modelers guidelines for translating LIDAR data to 3D fire models, and what fuel cell resolution can best capture accurate fire behavior.},

Results confirmed a significant decreasing effect of bulk density on rate of spread in a power law in both laboratory burns and simulations. However, experimental data showed a lesser effect than simulations, suggesting a difference in the effective drag. Fuel moisture content effect was highly consistent, showing a similar exponential relationship with rate of spread in laboratory and in simulations. FIRETEC simulations showed similar orders of magnitude with predictions of two field-based empirical models, finding a significant correlation between rate of spread values. The study confirms the efficacy of the combined approach through experimental data and simulations to study fire behaviour.},

To evaluate cultural burning as a form of human ecosystem engineering, we monitored hazelnut basketry stem production, qualities, and shrub density in 48 plots (400 m2) within two prescribed and 19 cultural burn sites. Socio-ecological variables that were analyzed included burn frequency, burn season, overstory tree ({$\geq$}10 cm diameter at breast height) basal area, ungulate browse, and aspect.

We attribute the moderated fire severity in the treated area to a significantly altered fuel profile created by the repeated prescribed fires.

A library of equations to estimate such fuels in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains is presented and used in an example. These methods can be used in other regions if the user first enters fuel size-class equations for a given region into a new library by using the library editor supplied with BIOPAK. Fuel size classes can be estimated in three ways: (1) When appropriate plant measurements are available, fuel classes can be estimated directly for species that have equations in the library or species with similar growth forms. (2) When appropriate plant measurements are not available, fuel classes can be estimated in two steps, first by estimating total aboveground biomass for individual plants and then by estimating biomass in fuel classes from total aboveground biomass. (3) The equations provided can be used to develop new equations that estimate fuels from plot-level estimates of species cover (and possibly other measures).},

  abstract = {Fires spreading in elevated vegetation, such as chaparral or pine forest canopies, are often more intense than fires spreading through surface vegetation such as grasslands. As a result, they are more difficult to suppress, produce higher heat fluxes, more firebrands and smoke, and can interact with, or create, local weather conditions that lead to dangerous fire behavior. Such wildland fires can pose a serious threat to wildland\textendash urban interface communities. A basic building block of such fires is a single tree. In the work presented here, a number of individual trees, of various characteristics, were burned without an imposed wind in the Large Fire Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards of Technology. A numerical model capable of representing the spatial distribution of vegetation in a tree crown is presented and evaluated against tree burning experiments. For simplicity, the vegetation was assumed to be uniformly distributed in a tree crown represented by a well defined geometric shape (cone or cylinder). Predictions of the time histories of the radiant heat flux and mass loss rates for different fuel moisture contents and tree heights compared favorably to measured values and trends. This work is a first step toward the development and application of a physics-based computer model to spatially complex, elevated, vegetation present in forest stands and in the wildland\textendash urban interface.},

  abstract = {Physics-based coupled fire\textendash atmosphere models are based on approximations to the governing equations of fluid dynamics, combustion, and the thermal degradation of solid fuel. They require significantly more computational resources than the most commonly used fire spread models, which are semi-empirical or empirical. However, there are a number of fire behaviour problems, of increasing relevance, that are outside the scope of empirical and semi-empirical models. Examples are wildland\textendash urban interface fires, assessing how well fuel treatments work to reduce the intensity of wildland fires, and investigating the mechanisms and conditions underlying blow-up fires and fire spread through heterogeneous fuels. These problems are not amenable to repeatable full-scale field studies. Suitably validated coupled atmosphere\textendash fire models are one way to address these problems. This paper describes the development of a three-dimensional, fully transient, physics-based computer simulation approach for modelling fire spread through surface fuels. Grassland fires were simulated and compared to findings from Australian experiments. Predictions of the head fire spread rate for a range of ambient wind speeds and ignition line-fire lengths compared favourably to experiments. In addition, two specific experimental cases were simulated in order to evaluate how well the model predicts the development of the entire fire perimeter.},

Currently, these approaches are too computationally expensive for operational use and, as for any fire behavior model, require validation through comparison to full-scale measurements. However, these ``physics-based'' models have the potential of providing a more complete understanding of fire behavior over a wider range of environmental conditions than empirically based models. The promise of physics-based models is not to replace the use of simpler and faster models, but to provide a well founded understanding of their limitations and a means of improving them. An example of this is to use the physics-based wildland-urban interface fire dynamics simulator (WFDS) to develop and evaluate a simpler level set model of surface fire spread. A basic implementation of the level set model performs reasonably well but requires further evaluation when applied to scenarios that include heterogeneous fuels and the potential influence of fire induced winds.},

In the United States, the WUI accounts for a significant portion of wildland fire suppression and wildland fuel treatment costs. Methods to reduce structure losses are focussed on fuel treatments in either wildland fuels or residential fuels. There is a need for a well-characterised, systematic testing of these approaches across a range of community and structure types and fire conditions. Laboratory experiments, field measurements and fire behaviour models can be used to better determine the exposure conditions faced by communities and structures. The outcome of such an effort would be proven fuel treatment techniques for wildland and residential fuels, risk assessment strategies, economic cost analysis models, and test methods with representative exposure conditions for fire-resistant building designs and materials.},

These drivers of global change are themselves novel ecosystem disturbances that may interact with historically occurring disturbances in complex ways. Here we use the natural experiment presented by wildfires in redwood forests impacted by an emerging infectious disease to demonstrate unexpected synergies of novel disturbance interactions. The dominant tree, coast redwood (fire resistant without negative disease impacts), experienced unexpected synergistic increases in mortality when fire and disease co-occurred. The increased mortality risk, more than fourfold at the peak of the effect, was not predictable from impacts of either disturbance alone. Changes in fire behavior associated with changes to forest fuels that occurred through disease progression overwhelmed redwood's usual resilience to wildfire. Our results demonstrate the potential for interacting disturbances to initiate novel successional trajectories and compromise ecosystem resilience.},

Results help define first-order mortality mechanisms and suggest second-order mortality mechanisms that should be incorporated into future modeling efforts.},

Nevertheless, some foresters and ecologists are unfamiliar with the approach and it remains a minority in fire ecology research. The purpose of this review is to describe in straightforward terms the fundamental biophysical processes that link fire behavior to tree mortality. The review begins with a brief introduction to heat transfer theory before moving on to combustion processes and forest fire behavior. A discussion follows on how fire behavior is linked to injuries in the tree roots, bole and crown, and finally a biophysical process framework for linking root, bole and crown injuries to tree mortality is outlined. It is hoped that this overview will promote future process approaches and help to produce more predictive and general models of postfire tree mortality.},

A more significant question may be whether the ecosystem impacts of wildfire are also increasing. We show that a large area (approximately 120000~km2) of California and western Nevada experienced a notable increase in the extent of forest stand-replacing (``high severity'') fire between 1984 and 2006. High severity forest fire is closely linked to forest fragmentation, wildlife habitat availability, erosion rates and sedimentation, post-fire seedling recruitment, carbon sequestration, and various other ecosystem properties and processes. Mean and maximum fire size, and the area burned annually have also all risen substantially since the beginning of the 1980s, and are now at or above values from the decades preceding the 1940s, when fire suppression became national policy. These trends are occurring in concert with a regional rise in temperature and a long-term increase in annual precipitation. A close examination of the climate\textendash fire relationship and other evidence suggests that forest fuels are no longer limiting fire occurrence and behavior across much of the study region. We conclude that current trends in forest fire severity necessitate a re-examination of the implications of all-out fire suppression and its ecological impacts.},

  abstract = {Current use of land surface curvatures (LSCs) is in a confused state as a large gap has opened up between applications and theoretical work. LSCs exercise important control on changes of gravity potential energy and the equilibrium of the surface, and they are increasingly used in geosciences but they are not consistently defined. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for definition, classification and interpretation of LSCs. Systematization of known and newly derived relationships between LSCs is followed by extension of the traditional scheme for interpretation. A new comprehensive system of LSCs starts with the basic trio: profile, plan and twisting curvatures, and includes their slope-dependent sub-forms, combinations and imitations. Analysis of their influence on changes of gravitational potential energy available for mass flows is crucial for their understanding, and leads to a new interpretation of difference curvature. The systematic evaluation of LSCs as expressions of slope disequilibrium offers a further interpretation: zero values of LSCs can be considered as important theoretical attractors of landform development. LSCs are increasingly employed for analyses of landslide, flood, snow avalanche, forest fire, soil erosion, mass balance, ground water, digital soil mapping, individual landform identification and land surface segmentation, modelling of landscape development, classification of LIDAR data and visualization of terrain features. Important improvement of LSC use in all these spheres is possible. They are mostly computed in geographical information systems with limited capabilities: the performance of ArcGIS, SAGA, GRASS, LandSerf, Surfer and MICRODEM is compared here. The important interrelations of DEM resolution, accuracy and generalization are demonstrated in relation to the nested hierarchy of land forms and processes. The best interpretable LSCs, and challenges of future progress, are specified at the close of the paper.},

  abstract = {To model ecosystem functioning for landscape design, analysts would like detailed data about each parcel of land in the landscape. Usually, only information of low resolution is available for the entire area, supplemented by detailed information for a sample of the parcels. These sample data, usually obtained through two-phase sampling, provide initial values of important design elements for dynamic, often nonlinear, models of ecosystem functioning. However, to represent the contribution of the nonsampled portions of the landscape to ecosystem functioning, it would be convenient to be able to operate as if the detailed design information were available for each and every parcel in the analysis. Inference procedures to complete the design information for the unsampled parcels have usually followed the techniques of stratified or regression sampling. These procedures have been developed with regard to their efficiency for estimating population means and totals rather than for their utility to model ecosystem functioning and response to intervention. Stratified sampling or regression estimates therefore do not retain the complex relationships between multivariate design attributes. We present a new multivariate inference procedure for use in such circumstances. In place of estimating design attributes element-by-element in a traditional sense for each first-phase observation, the procedure simply chooses the most similar parcel from the set of parcels with detailed examinations to act as its stand-in. The stand-in is chosen on the basis of a similarity measure that summarizes the multivariate relationships between the set of low resolution indicator attributes and the set of detailed design attributes derived from the second-phase sample. Canonical correlation analysis is used to derive a similarity function for this procedure, which we call "Most Similar Neighbor Inference." We compared most similar neighbor estimates for a multivariate forest inventory to estimates from regression, stratified sampling, and a Swedish National Forest Survey method. The indicator attributes were recorded from stand records, maps, and aerial photographs, while the design attributes were stand yield characteristics derived from on-the-ground inventories. The most similar neighbor estimates have prediction errors that are comparable in magnitude to the traditional estimates for easy-to-predict design attributes. Thus, most similar neighbor inference should be expected to perform almost as well as regression in sampling contexts requiring estimates of population means or totals. More importantly, the most similar neighbor procedure more closely reproduces the covariance structure of the design attributes. Preserving the relationships among design attributes is a vital feature when the purpose of the modeling is to evaluate management options. Furthermore, because most similar neighbor is an exact interpolator, estimates derived from it are consistent in a finite population sense. For. Sci. 41(2):337-359.},

  abstract = {Climate change and the accumulation of surface fuel are leading to global changes in the occurrence of increasingly severe fires. In light of current budgetary constraints, prescribed fire can be a very cost-efficient tool for both reducing wildfire hazards and managing fire-prone landscapes. However, despite its widespread use in some countries, social and administrative constraints arise when applied at the European or larger scales. Science-based knowledge concerning fire behavior, fuel load reduction, and tree impacts is required to support the use of prescribed fire. Spatial ignition patterns can increase or decrease the spread rate, flame length, and flame residence time according to the objectives of a prescribed fire. This work aims to analyze fire behavior using different fire ignition patterns (strip-heading fire, flanking fire, and spot-heading fire) and meteorological and fuel conditions. Seventy-seven observations or sampling units using twenty-three prescribed fires were established for fire monitoring. Non-linear models based on environmental variables were fitted for the spread rate and flame length. Our study proposes a novel way of sharing scientific knowledge in relation to the most common distances between ignition lines and ignition points used in the southern Iberian Peninsula. The spread rate and flame length can be increased in strip-heading fire, by more than 3.5-fold and more than 1.95-fold, respectively, by modifying only the distance between ignition lines. Flanking fire could lead to a decrease in the spread rate by approximately half. Although spot-heading fire can reduce the spread rate by more than 78\% and flame length by more than 41\%, the highest distances between points could increase the flame residence time by 39\textendash 132\%. This research seeks to achieve a trade-off between fire intensity and the impacts of fire on trees, soil, and surface roots.},

Spatial distribution of fuel elements, sorted according to their characteristic thickness, was established from destructive measurements. 28 fire tests were conducted with full plants under a calorimeter. Foliar moisture content was in the range of 4\textendash 18\% on dry basis. Radiant panels were used as source of ignition. Flammability was investigated using ignitability, sustainability, combustibility and consumability. Comparison to previous studies highlighted the necessity of standardization among test procedures. Principal component analysis revealed four flammability regimes depending on proportion of thin fuel elements within the crown, position of ignition and duration of preheating. Finally, combustion dynamics of a shrub was numerically investigated with WFDS. A bulk density model was developed from the characterization study and used as input data for the numerical code. Predicted HRR was in good agreement with experiments, although simulation results need improvement in initiation phase of burning.},

However, their application to wildland fire scenarios requires evaluation against relevant experimental data. To progress our current understanding of the fidelity of a CFD approach to simulating wildland fire dynamics, a dataset from an experimental fire was used as a test case. First, implications of the level of detail provided to the model, in the form of fuel structure and wind, are evaluated. Second, the predictions of both fire behavior (e.g. spread rate) and the driving combustion processes (e.g. heat flux) are compared to the experiment. It was found that both increasing the detail in canopy fuel structure and implementing turbulent boundary conditions had a minor impact. It was further found that the model reproduced fire behavior in the mid-range of experimental observations and that the representation of local combustion processes was qualitatively consistent. This work demonstrates the promising capabilities of the modeling approach used here, while showing that some of its aspects require further investigation and possibly more development.},

However, there  remain significant uncertainties and assumptions in the way such models describe the  fire, the vegetation, and the interaction of the two. To understand a model's  capabilities, limitations, and the improvements which are still necessary, comparison  of model predictions to experimental measurement is critical. Unfortunately, collecting  such measurements is particularly difficult at the large scale over which real wildland  fires occur and, as a result, this happens infrequently. To address this, an opportunity  was seized to collect a detailed set of measurements of fire behavior in a real forest  environment. These measurements are thoroughly analyzed for the description they  provide of the fire behavior. They are then used as a benchmark to test the capabilities  of a particular complex model to describe such a fire and to highlight the limitations  and uncertainties. As a result of this evaluation, a set of recommendations for future  research, both in experiments and modeling, are offered, in order provide a coherent  strategy for the future which will significantly advance these models.},

However, due to the complexity of the models, individual aspects must be isolated and tested rigorously to ensure meaningful results. As wind is a driving force that can significantly dictate the behavior of a wildfire, the simulation of wind is studied in the context of a particular LES CFD model, the Wildland\textendash urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS). As WFDS has yet to be tested extensively with regard to wind flow within and above forest canopies, a study of its ability to do so is carried out. First, three simulations are conducted using periodic boundary conditions. Two of these assume a spatially heterogeneous forest and one models wind downstream of a canopy edge. Second, two simulations are conducted with specified ``inflow'' conditions using two inflow profiles: one static and one dynamic (driven by a precursor simulation). Using periodic boundary conditions, the model is found to generate profiles of mean velocity and turbulent statistics that are representative of experimental measurements. The dynamic inflow scenario is found to perform better than the static case.},

In particular, detailed descriptions of individual fires are required, for which the available literature is limited. In this work, two such field-scale experiments, carried out in pine stands under mild conditions, are presented. A particular focus was placed on non-intrusive measurement, as the capabilities of advanced remote sensing techniques, along with more traditional approaches, are explored. A description of the fires is presented, with spread occurring predominantly in the surface fuels with intensities in the range of 200\textendash 4400kWm-1, and punctuated by isolated regions of crown fire. The occurrence of crown fire is investigated and linked to regions of greater canopy density, and it is found that the total fire intensity may increase locally to as much as 21,000kWm-1. The light winds do not appear to play a direct role in the changes in fire behavior, while fuel structure may be important. The measurements described herein provided a reasonable overall description of the fires, however, the current resolution (both spatial and temporal) falls short of definitively explaining some transitional aspects of the fire behavior, and future improvements are suggested.},

Improving the accuracy of mapping fuel models is essential for fuel management decisions and explicit fire behavior prediction for real-time support of suppression tactics and logistics decisions. The overall aim of this paper is to develop the use of lidar (LIght Detection and Ranging) remote sensing to accurately and effectively assess fuel models in East Texas. More specific goals include: (1) developing lidar derived products and the methodology to use them for assessing fuel models; (2) investigating the use of several techniques for data fusion of lidar and multispectral imagery for assessing fuel models; (3) investigating the gain in fuels mapping accuracy when using lidar as opposed to QuickBird imagery alone; and (4) producing spatially explicit digital fuel maps. Estimates of fuel models were compared with in-situ data collected over 62 plots. We employ a unique approach to classify fuel models using a combination of lidar height bins and multispectral image data. Different image processing approaches for fusing lidar and multispectral data, such as the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), were used to improve the overall accuracy of image classification. Supervised image classification methods provided better accuracy (90.10\%) with the fusion of airborne lidar data with QuickBird data than with QuickBird imagery alone (76.52\%). According to our results, lidar derived data provide accurate estimates of surface fuel parameters efficiently and accurately over extensive areas of forests. This study demonstrates the importance of using accurate maps of fuel models derived using new lidar remote sensing techniques.},

  abstract = {The prediction of the diameter distribution of a stand is of great interest to forest managers for the evaluation of forest resources and scheduling the future silvicultural treatments. In the present paper, we present a geostatistical approach for the prediction of diameter distributions. The advantage of the proposed method over traditional prediction systems is that it is possible to estimate the diameter distribution at locations, where no secondary variables are measured. The Weibull and the Chaudhry\textendash Ahmad probability density functions were fitted by maximum likelihood to the diameter distribution of 176 plots of pure, even aged stands of Pinus pinaster Ait. located in the province of Segovia of central Spain. Data were taken from the Second National Forest Inventory of Spain. The spatial ``behaviour'' of the parameters of the density functions was studied by variogram analysis and the results showed that all parameters were spatially correlated to some extent. Kriging was used for the interpolation of parameters of the diameter distributions over the study area. Cross-validation was performed separately for every parameter. Results showed that the Weibull function gave smaller relative bias in the prediction of the diameter sum. Additionally, the likelihood ratio was used to compare the fit of the density functions. This ratio was computed twice: firstly when parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood and secondly, when parameters were predicted by kriging-cross-validation. The Chaudhry\textendash Ahmad function fitted better the actual diameter distributions when maximum-likelihood was used for parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the fit of the Weibull was much better when kriging was used for parameter prediction. The prediction of the diameter distribution was made using data from the National Forest Inventory, therefore predictions should be used for regional planning and estimation of forest resources at this spatial scale (national). For forest management purposes at a local scale, data sources taken at fine spatial scales should be preferred. The spatial discontinuities that the forest compartments introduce during kriging interpolation are finally discussed and some solutions are proposed.},

Experimental fires, during the summer and fall of 1986, in stands of redwood located in Redwood National Park, determined the fuel bed characteristics (fuel depth, load, and moisture) and local weather conditions (temperature and relative humidity) necessary to sustain a low intensity ground fire. Elevation and topographic position, and how they influence fuel moisture, emerged as the determining factors related to ease of fire ignition and rates of spread. Fuel depth and load appeared to affect the intensity and duration of the fires and rate of spread. Once favorable burning conditions were determined, a burning window was identified. The lower threshold conditions were relative humidity less than 40 percent and temperature greater than 20\textdegree C. The best time of day for burning was mid-afternoon. This burning window was limited to a few day per month.  Preliminary equations to predict flame length were developed using multiple regression and compared with Rothermel's Fuel Model "8". Linear regression analysis determined that the created prediction equation was a better predictor of flame length than Rothermel's Model.},

New fire regimes have the potential to drive species extinctions and cause ecosystem state changes, with a range of consequences for ecosystem services. Despite the co-occurrence of forest fires with drought, current approaches to modelling flammability largely overlook the large body of research into plant vulnerability to drought. Here, we outline the mechanisms through which plant responses to drought may affect forest flammability, specifically fuel moisture and the ratio of dead to live fuels. We present a framework for modelling live fuel moisture content (moisture content of foliage and twigs) from soil water content and plant traits, including rooting patterns and leaf traits such as the turgor loss point, osmotic potential, elasticity and leaf mass per area. We also present evidence that physiological drought stress may contribute to previously observed fuel moisture thresholds in south-eastern Australia. Of particular relevance is leaf cavitation and subsequent shedding, which transforms live fuels into dead fuels, which are drier, and thus easier to ignite. We suggest that capitalising on drought research to inform wildfire research presents a major opportunity to develop new insights into wildfires, and new predictive models of seasonal fuel dynamics.},

  abstract = {The moisture content of live fuels is an important determinant of forest flammability. Current approaches for modelling live fuel moisture content typically focus on the use of drought indices. However, these have mixed success partly because of species-specific differences in drought responses. Here we seek to understand the physiological mechanisms driving changes in live fuel moisture content, and to investigate the potential for incorporating plant physiological traits into live fuel moisture models. We measured the dynamics of leaf moisture content, access to water resources (through stable isotope analyses) and physiological traits (including leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and cellular osmotic and elastic adjustments) across a fire season in a Mediterranean mixed forest in Catalonia, NE Spain. We found that differences in both seasonal variation and minimum values of live fuel moisture content were a function of access to water resources and plant physiological traits. Specifically, those species with the lowest minimum moisture content and largest seasonal variation in moisture (Cistus albidus: 49\textendash 137\% and Rosmarinus officinalis: 47\textendash 144\%) were most reliant on shallow soil water and had the lowest values of predawn leaf water potential. Species with the smallest variation in live fuel moisture content (Pinus nigra: 96\textendash 116\% and Quercus ilex: 56\textendash 91\%) exhibited isohydric behaviour (little variation in midday leaf water potential, and relatively tight regulation of stomata in response to soil drying). Of the traits measured, predawn leaf water potential provided the strongest predictor of live fuel moisture content (R2 = 0.63, AIC\,=\,249), outperforming two commonly used drought indices (both with R2 = 0.49, AIC\,=\,258). This is the first study to explicitly link fuel moisture with plant physiology and our findings demonstrate the potential and importance of incorporating ecophysiological plant traits to investigating seasonal changes in fuel moisture and, more broadly, forest flammability.},

  abstract = {Fuel treatment effectiveness is often evaluated with fire behavior modeling systems that use fuel models to generate fire behavior outputs. How surface fuels are assigned, either using one of the 53 stylized fuel models or developing custom fuel models, can affect predicted fire behavior. We collected surface and canopy fuels data before and 1, 2, 5, and 8 years after prescribed fire treatments across 10 national forests in California. Two new methods of assigning fuel models within the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator were evaluated. Field-based values for dead and downed fuel loading were used to create custom fuel models or to assign stylized fuel models. Fire was simulated with two wind scenarios (maximum 1-minute speed and maximum momentary gust speed) to assess the effect of the fuel model method on potential fire behavior. Surface flame lengths and fire type produced from custom fuel models followed the fluctuations and variability of fine fuel loading more closely than stylized fuel models. However, results of 7 out of 10 statistical tests comparing surface flame length between custom and stylized fuel models were not significant (P \&lt; 0.05), suggesting that both methods used to assign surface fuel loads will predict fairly similar trends in fire behavior.},

  abstract = {The tradeoffs that surround forest management are inherently complex, often involving multiple temporal and spatial scales. For example, conflicts may result when fuel treatments are designed to mediate long-term fuel hazards, but activities could impair sensitive aquatic habitat or degrade wildlife habitat in the short term. This complexity makes it hard for managers to describe and communicate the conditional nature of risk and to justify planned activities to stakeholders. In addition, our understanding of how proposed activities will affect resources of concern is often limited owing to informational shortcomings and imprecise models. To be robust and transparent, a risk assessment framework needs to reveal these limitations while quantifying the probable outcomes of project effects to multiple resources of concern. In this analysis, we describe the effects of fuel treatments using such a planning framework called CRAFT (Comparative Risk Assessment Framework and Tools). CRAFT provides a platform from which diverse ancillary models and other relevant information can be transparently integrated and evaluated. We conducted our case study in the southwestern Klamath Mountains of California. As is typical of most montane forests of California, this area has experienced decades of fire suppression, and severe effects from wildfire are a concern. Working with managers, we identified a range of measurable objectives involving the wildland urban interface, fire behavior, fire effects, and sensitive wildlife. We then developed a conceptual model describing how components of the system interrelate. From this, we developed a probabilistic framework, using Bayesian belief networks, in which we employed existing fire models to address how expected fire behavior varies across different burning scenarios. Our framework provides decisionmakers and stakeholders with insights into the condition probability that management alternatives will be successful.},

  abstract = {Coast redwood forests rank among the most significant natural features of North America, yet our understanding of how they came to be and how we might sustain them has been beset by scientific and management uncertainty for decades. A key part of this controversy has been the historical importance of fire given the mild coastal climate and small number of lightning ignitions. In the northern part of the coast redwood range, past research found that fire was uncommon, but results conflicted with others that found fire to be as frequent as in any dry forest of western North America. We established tree-ring based fire histories from across the northern coast redwood range to redress this conflict. We found that methodological shortcomings were responsible for the long fire intervals obtained in other studies, and that fire had burned with high frequency in the majority of sites examined during recent centuries. This discovery is supported by converging evidence from the pattern of basal fire cavities across the landscape. We use ethnographic and archaeological data to explain why this pattern of historical fire from scars and cavities deviates from what is expected from latitudinal and coast-to-interior climate gradients. We describe the extraordinary productivity of fuels in this forest type using an extensive array of fuels transects. While results show that these forests are not limited by fuels, fire in coast redwood is conditionally limited by ignitions and fire weather. Insights from this research help inform where prescribed fire can be used to balance the competing objectives of sustaining forest diversity that often results from fire and minimizing the loss of ancient coast redwood trees that often die because of fire.},

We propose a pyrosilviculture approach to directly increase large-scale fire use and modify current thinning treatments to optimize future fire incorporation. Recommendations include leveraging wildfire's ``treatment'' in areas burned at low and moderate severity with subsequent pyrosilviculture management, identifying managed wildfire zones, and facilitating and financing prescribed fire with ``anchor,'' ``ecosystem asset,'' and ``revenue'' focused thinning treatments. Pyrosilviculture would also expand prescribed-burn and managed-wildfire objectives to include reducing stand density, increasing forest heterogeneity, and selecting for tree species and phenotypes better adapted to changing climate and disturbance regimes. The potential benefits and limitations of this approach are discussed. Fire is inevitable in dry western US forests and pyrosilviculture focuses on proactively shifting more of that fire into managed large-scale burns needed to restore ecosystem resilience.},

In forests that historically had frequent fire regimes, the scale of current fuels reduction treatments has often been too limited to affect fire severity and the Forest Service has predominantly focused on suppression. In addition to continued treatment of the wildland urban interface, increasing the scale of low- and moderate-severity fire would have substantial ecological and economics benefits if implemented soon. We suggest National Forests identify large contiguous areas to concentrate their fuels reduction efforts, and then turn treated firesheds over to prescribed and managed wildfire for future maintenance. A new round of forest planning provides an opportunity to identify and overcome some of the current cultural, regulatory, and institutional barriers to increased fire use that we discuss.},

Second, that fire behavior is heterogeneous at many scales both spatially and temporally, and that heat transfer occurs in three dimensions is only now being appreciated. Spatially and temporally resolved measurement of heat and mass transport in fires is difficult; and even when fire is measured, it is often measured in ways that are not relevant to the effects of interest. General measurements like flame length, rate of spread, and consumption are only approximate descriptors of a complicated energy transfer environment and are of limited use~when linking fires to their effects.},

Furthermore, spatially and temporally explicit measurements are critical for making inferences about fire effects and useful for examining patterns of fire spread. In this study we describe our methods for capturing and analysing spatially and temporally explicit long-wave infrared (LWIR) imagery from the RxCADRE (Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment) project and examine the usefulness of these data in investigating fire behaviour and effects. We compare LWIR imagery captured at fine and moderate spatial and temporal resolutions (from 1 cm2 to 1 m2; and from 0.12 to 1 Hz) using both nadir and oblique measurements. We analyse fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of fire radiant power and energy released in several experimental burns. There was concurrence between the measurements, although the oblique view estimates of fire radiative power were consistently higher than the nadir view estimates. The nadir measurements illustrate the significance of fuel characteristics, particularly type and connectivity, in driving spatial variability at fine scales. The nadir and oblique measurements illustrate the usefulness of the data for describing the location and movement of the fire front at discrete moments in time at these fine and moderate resolutions. Spatially and temporally resolved data from these techniques show promise to effectively link the combustion environment with post-fire processes, remote sensing at larger scales and wildland fire modelling efforts.},

  abstract = {Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex. D. Don) Endl.) is unique among conifer species because of its longevity, the great sizes of individual trees, and its propensity to reproduce through sprouts. Timber harvesting in the native redwood range along the coast of the western United States has necessitated restoration aimed to promote old forest structures to increase the total amount of old forest, the connectivity between old forests, and to enhance the resiliency of these ecosystems. After disturbance or harvest, healthy redwood stumps sprout vigorously, often producing dozens of sprouts within two years of disturbance. These sprouts form highly aggregated spatial patterns because they are clustered around stumps that may number less than 50 ha-1. Thinning of sprouts can accelerate individual tree growth, providing an effective restoration strategy to accelerate formation of large trees and old forest structures or increase stand growth for timber production. However, management, including restoration activities, is a contentious issue throughout the native range of redwood because of the history of overexploitation of this resource and perceptions that overexploitation is continuing. This paper reviews the science of early stand dynamics in coast redwood and their implications for restoration and other silvicultural strategies.},

  abstract = {To accelerate development of old forest features in coast redwood, two thinning treatments and an unthinned control were compared in three treatment areas in north coastal California. One thinning treatment was designed to restore old forest densities of 125 trees/ha and the other 250 trees/ha representing a one-step and partial treatments to the desired stand density. Four years after treatment, numbers of trees had increased in the thinning treatments due to recruitment of new trees, but had decreased in the control due to self-thinning. Residual trees increased in stem volume following thinning by 128\% in low-density thinning compared to 70\% in the controls indicating thinning accelerated stand development. The thinning treatments also moved the species composition of these stands to a greater proportion of redwood. Considerable slash was produced by the thinning treatments but was decomposing rapidly. Black bears damaged approximately 15\% of all trees and more than 38\% of residual trees in the thinned treatments compared to less than 2\% of all trees in the control. This damage included killing some trees and damaging other trees that survived. Decisions over restoration densities in these stands are complicated by prolonged stand development, and balancing risks and costs. In this case, the bears represent a stochastic factor that dramatically increases risk. Thinning appears to be an effective means of enhancing old forest development by accelerating tree growth, modifying species composition, and increasing stand-level variability. Continued monitoring will be necessary to evaluate long-term trends in density relative to effects of bear damage.},

Species composition was 74\% redwood and 23\% coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Treatments were replicated across seven stands and monitored for 12 years. Data analysis included both analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare treatment means and mixed-effects modeling to examine broader trends and important variables affecting increment. The ANOVA used target treatment densities as the predictor variable, whereas the mixed models used actual posttreatment densities. Results showed great variation within treatments, largely because high variability in spatial patterns of regeneration resulted in difficulty achieving target initial treatment densities. Ingrowth from sprouting redwood and, to a lesser extent, broadleaved trees and seedlings of other conifers also contributed to large variation in density levels. Results indicate tree increment generally decreased with increasing density and stand increment increased with density. Total stand increment, including both initial trees and ingrowth, was highest at the 4 \dbend{} 4-ft spacing and lower in control treatments and thinning treatments that left lower densities. Both analysis procedures provide useful information to guide evaluation of thinning studies and complementary results to guide management regimes.},

The FCCS 3.0 is housed within the Integrated Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (Joint Fire Science Program 2012). It can also be run from command line as a stand-alone calculator. The flexible design of FCCS allows users to represent the structural complexity and diversity of fuels created through natural processes (e.g., forest succession and disturbance) and management activities (e.g., forest harvesting and fuels reduction). Each fuelbed is organized into six strata, including canopy, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation, woody fuels, litter-lichen-moss, and ground fuels. Strata are further divided into categories and subcategories. Fuelbeds representing common fuel types throughout much of North America are available in the FCCS reference library. Users may select an FCCS fuelbed to represent their specific project or customize a fuelbed to reflect actual site conditions. The FCCS reports the following results: (1) fuel characteristics by fuelbed, stratum, category, and subcategory; (2) surface fire behavior (i.e., reaction intensity, rate of spread, and flame length); and (3) FCCS fire potential ratings of surface fire behavior, crown fire behavior, and available fuels. With its large fuels data set and ability to represent a wide variety of fuel conditions, the FCCS has numerous applications, from small-scale fuel reduction projects to large-scale emissions and carbon assessments.

  abstract = {The lack of independent, quality-assured field data prevents scientists from effectively evaluating and advancing wildland fire models. To rectify this, scientists and technicians convened in the south-eastern United States in 2008, 2011 and 2012 to collect wildland fire data in six integrated core science disciplines defined by the fire modelling community. These were fuels, meteorology, fire behaviour, energy, smoke emissions and fire effects. The campaign is known as the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment (RxCADRE) and sampled 14 forest and 14 non-forest sample units associated within 6 small replicate ({$<$}10 ha) and 10 large operational (between 10 and 1000 ha) prescribed fires. Precampaign planning included identifying hosting agencies receptive to research and the development of study, logistics and safety plans. Data were quality-assured, reduced, analysed and formatted and placed into a globally accessible repository maintained by the US Forest Service Research Data Archive. The success of the RxCADRE project led to the commencement of a follow-on larger multiagency project called the Fire and Smoke Model Evaluation Experiment (FASMEE). This overview summarises the RxCADRE project and nine companion papers that describe the data collection, analysis and important conclusions from the six science disciplines.},

  abstract = {We present an overview of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool that enables land managers, regulators, and scientists to create and catalogue fuelbeds and to classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. The fuelbed characteristics and fire classification from this tool will provide inputs for current and future sophisticated models for the quantification of fire behavior, fire effects, and carbon accounting and enable assessment of fuel treatment effectiveness. The system was designed from requirements provided by land managers, scientists, and policy makers gathered through six regional workshops. The FCCS contains a set of fuelbeds representing the United States, which were compiled from scientific literature, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert opinion. The system enables modification and enhancement of these fuelbeds to represent a particular scale of interest. The FCCS then reports assigned and calculated fuel characteristics for each existing fuelbed stratum including the canopy, shrubs, nonwoody, woody, litter\textendash lichen\textendash moss, and duff. Finally, the system classifies each fuelbed by calculating fire potentials that provide an index of the intrinsic capacity of each fuelbed to support surface fire behavior, support crown fire, and provide fuels for flaming, smoldering, and residual consumption. The FCCS outputs are being used in a national wildland fire emissions inventory and in the development of fuelbed, fire hazard, and treatment effectiveness maps on several national forests. Although the FCCS was built for the United States, the conceptual framework is applicable worldwide.},

Diameter distribution models are usually applied, since measuring empirical diameter distributions in practical forest inventories is too laborious. This study investigated the ability of remote sensing information to predict species-specific diameter distributions. The study was carried out in Finland in a typical managed boreal forest area. The tree species considered were Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and deciduous trees as a group. Growing stock was estimated using the k-MSN method using airborne laser scanning data and aerial photographs. Two approaches were compared: first, the nearest neighbour approach based on field measured trees was used as such to predict diameter distribution, and second, a theoretical diameter distribution approach in which the parameters of the Weibull distribution are predicted using the k-MSN estimates was applied. Basically, all test criteria indicated that the diameter distribution based on nearest neighbour imputed trees outperforms the Weibull distribution, but care must be taken to ensure that the modelling data are comprehensive enough.},

These have usually considered tree stock as a whole, even though it is tree species-specific forest information that is of primary interest in Finland, for example. We will therefore concentrate here on prediction of the species-specific forest variables volume, stem number, basal area, basal area median diameter and tree height, applying the non-parametric k-MSN method to a combination of ALS data and aerial photographs in order to predict these stand attributes simultaneously for Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees as well as total characteristics as sums of the species-specific estimates. The predictor variables derived from the ALS data were based on the height distribution of vegetation hits, whereas spectral values and texture features were employed in the case of the aerial photographs. The data covered 463 sample plots in 67 stands in eastern Finland, and the results showed that this approach can be used to predict species-specific forest variables at least as accurately as from the current stand-level field inventory for Finland. The characteristics of Scots pine and Norway spruce were predicted more accurately than those of deciduous trees.},

This article compares two approaches for determining species-specific volumes at plot level by combining ALS data with aerial photographs. The first approach consists of two stages: (1) prediction of total volume using ALS data, and (2) assignment of this total volume to tree species by fuzzy classification and aerial photographs, in which three fuzzy classification methods were tested. In the second approach, volumes by tree species and the total volume are predicted simultaneously using a nonparametric k-most similar neighbor (k-MSN) method based on both ALS data and aerial photographs in one phase. The test area, located in Finland, consists of 463 sample plots. Species-specific volumes were estimated for pine, spruce, and the deciduous trees as a species group, total volume being the sum of the species-specific volumes. The k-MSN method produced considerably more accurate estimates for the species-specific volumes than any fuzzy classification method, the relative RMSEs for the volumes of pine, spruce, and deciduous trees being 45.50\%, 61.98\%, and 92.30\%, respectively, and that for the total volume 23.86\%.},

Here we evaluate fire severity trends and their interannual relationships to climate for western US forests from 1985 to 2017. Significant increases in annual area burned at high severity (AABhs) were observed across most ecoregions, with an overall eightfold increase in AABhs across western US forests. The relationships we identified between the annual fire severity metrics and climate, as well as the observed and projected trend toward warmer and drier fire seasons, suggest that climate change will contribute to increased fire severity in future decades where fuels remain abundant. The growing prevalence of high-severity fire in western US forests has important implications to forest ecosystems, including an increased probability of fire-catalyzed conversions from forest to alternative vegetation types.},

  abstract = {In the southeastern USA, land use history, forest management and natural geomorphic features have created heterogeneous fuel loads. This apparent temporal and spatial variation in fuel loads make it difficult to reliably assess potential fire behavior from remotely sensed canopy variables to determine risk and to prescribe treatments. We examined this variation by exploring the relationships between overstory forest vegetation attributes, recent fire history, and selected surface fuel components across an 80,000ha contiguous landscape. Measurements of dead and live vegetation components of surface fuels were obtained from 624 permanent plots, or about 1 plot per 100ha of forest cover. Within forest vegetation groups, we modeled the relationship between individual surface fuel components and overstory stand age, basal area, site quality and recent fire history, then stochastically predicted fuel loads across the landscape using the same linkage variables. The fraction of the plot variation, i.e., R2, explained by predictive models for individual fuel components ranged from 0.05 to 0.66 for dead fuels and 0.03 to 0.97 for live fuels in pine dominated vegetation groups. Stand age and basal area were generally more important than recent fire history for predicting fuel loads. Mapped fuel loads using these regressor variables showed a very heterogeneous landscape even at the scale of a few square kilometers. The mapped patterns corresponded to stand based forest management disturbances that are reflected in age, basal area, and fire history. Recent fire history was significant in explaining variation in litter and duff biomass. Stand basal area was positively and consistently related to dead fuel biomass in most groups and was present in many predictive equations. Patterns in live fuel biomass were related to recent fire history, but the patterns were not consistent among forest vegetation groups. Age and basal area were related to live fuels in a complex manner that is likely confounded with periodic disturbances that disrupt stand dynamics. This study complements earlier hazardous fuels research in the southeastern USA, and indicates that succession, disturbance, site quality and decomposition interact with forest management practices to create variable spatial and temporal conditions. The inclusion of additional land use, disturbance history, and soil-topographic variables coupled to improved sampling methods may increase precision and subsequent fuel mapping.},

  abstract = {Crown fire endangers fire fighters and can have severe ecological consequences. Prediction of fire behavior in tree crowns is essential to informed decisions in fire management. Current methods used in fire management do not address variability in crown fuels. New mechanistic physics-based fire models address convective heat transfer with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and can be used to model fire in heterogeneous crown fuels. However, the potential impacts of variability in crown fuels on fire behavior have not yet been explored. In this study we describe a new model, FUEL3D, which incorporates the pipe model theory (PMT) and a simple 3D recursive branching approach to model the distribution of fuel within individual tree crowns. FUEL3D uses forest inventory data as inputs, and stochastically retains geometric variability observed in field data. We investigate the effects of crown fuel heterogeneity on fire behavior with a CFD fire model by simulating fire under a homogeneous tree crown and a heterogeneous tree crown modeled with FUEL3D, using two different levels of surface fire intensity. Model output is used to estimate the probability of tree mortality, linking fire behavior and fire effects at the scale of an individual tree. We discovered that variability within a tree crown altered the timing, magnitude and dynamics of how fire burned through the crown; effects varied with surface fire intensity. In the lower surface fire intensity case, the heterogeneous tree crown barely ignited and would likely survive, while the homogeneous tree had nearly 80\% fuel consumption and an order of magnitude difference in total net radiative heat transfer. In the higher surface fire intensity case, both cases burned readily. Differences for the homogeneous tree between the two surface fire intensity cases were minimal but were dramatic for the heterogeneous tree. These results suggest that heterogeneity within the crown causes more conditional, threshold-like interactions with fire. We conclude with discussion of implications for fire behavior modeling and fire ecology.},

  abstract = {Landscape heterogeneity shapes species distributions, interactions, and fluctuations. Historically, in dry forest ecosystems, low canopy cover and heterogeneous fuel patterns often moderated disturbances like fire. Over the last century, however, increases in canopy cover and more homogeneous patterns have contributed to altered fire regimes with higher fire severity. Fire management strategies emphasize increasing within-stand heterogeneity with aggregated fuel patterns to alter potential fire behavior. Yet, little is known about how such patterns may affect fire behavior, or how sensitive fire behavior changes from fuel patterns are to winds and canopy cover. Here, we used a physics-based fire behavior model, FIRETEC, to explore the impacts of spatially aggregated fuel patterns on the mean and variability of stand-level fire behavior, and to test sensitivity of these effects to wind and canopy cover. Qualitative and quantitative approaches suggest that spatial fuel patterns can significantly affect fire behavior. Based on our results we propose three hypotheses: (1) aggregated spatial fuel patterns primarily affect fire behavior by increasing variability; (2) this variability should increase with spatial scale of aggregation; and (3) fire behavior sensitivity to spatial pattern effects should be more pronounced under moderate wind and fuel conditions.},

  abstract = {Forests in the western United States and elsewhere face a growing crisis arising from global warming, changes in fuel beds and an increasing human population. Fire management policy emphasizes fuel treatments, such as thinning and prescribed burning, to remedy this situation because fuels are the one component of the problem that we can directly affect through management action. At present, however, the tools we have for the evaluation of fuel treatments are inadequate because they do not describe the fuel bed, or effects of modifications to the fuel bed on fire behavior in sufficient detail. The work described here presents a system that has potential to address the shortcomings of current approaches. In the first chapter, to improve our ability to represent wildland fuels, a three dimensional spatially explicit fuel model, FUEL3D, is presented which represents fuels at a level of detail comparable to what we can actually measure: stands as collections of individual trees, with branches and foliage. In conjunction with new, physical fire models, detailed fire behavior simulations can be carried out using fuels represented with FUEL3D as inputs. This system thus comprises a simulation laboratory which will greatly enhance our capabilities to evaluate fuel treatments and strengthen our understanding of fire and fuel interactions. In the second chapter, this system is demonstrated in an exploratory simulation study which examines the impact of spatial variability within an individual tree crown on fire behavior. Results demonstrate that the distribution of fuel within a tree crown significantly affects the rate of fuel consumption, as well as the timing, duration and magnitude of heat produced. This suggests that modeling of both crown fire initiation and propagation would benefit from more detailed description of crown fuels. In third chapter a replicated series of stand scale fire simulations is carried out to examine variability in forward spread rate; accelerated spread rates endanger fire fighters. Substantial variability is observed to arise from fine scale fuel-atmosphere-fire interactions which are not easily predicted beforehand. A new strategy is proposed in which physical fire models are used to quantify the potential drivers of variability in fire behavior.},

A range of statistical methods, evaluation frameworks and modeling approaches have been applied for conducting structured environmental decision-making under uncertainty.

In this paper, we apply a BDN to decisions regarding fire management to evaluate the general efficacy and utility of the approach in resource and environmental decision-making. The study was undertaken in south-eastern Australia to examine decisions about prescribed burning rates and locations based on treatment and impact costs. Least-cost solutions were identified but are unlikely to be socially acceptable or practical within existing resources; however, the statistical approach allowed for the identification of alternative, more practical solutions. BDNs provided a transparent and effective method for a multi-criteria decision analysis of environmental management problems.},

  abstract = {We describe a range of methods for the description and analysis of spatial point patterns in plant ecology. The conceptual basis of the methods is presented, and specific tests are compared, with the goal of providing guidelines concerning their appropriate selection and use. Simulated and real data sets are used to explore the ability of these methods to identify different components of spatial pattern (e.g. departure from randomness, regularity vs. aggregation, scale and strength of pattern). First-order tests suffer from their inability to characterise pattern at distances beyond those at which local interactions (i.e. nearest neighbours) occur. Nevertheless, the tests explored (first-order nearest neighbour, Diggle's G and F) are useful first steps in analysing spatial point patterns, and all seem capable of accurately describing patterns at these (shorter) distances. Among second-order tests, a density-corrected form of the neighbourhood density function (NDF), a non-cumulative analogue of the commonly used Ripley's K-function, most informatively characterised spatial patterns at a range of distances for both univariate and bivariate analyses. Although Ripley's K is more commonly used, it can give very different results to the NDF because of its cumulative nature. A modified form of the K-function suitable for inhomogeneous point patterns is discussed. We also explore the use of local and spatially-explicit methods for point pattern analysis. Local methods are powerful in that they allow variations from global averages to be detected and potentially provide a link to recent spatial ecological theory by taking the ,plant's-eye view'. We conclude by discussing the problems of linking spatial pattern with ecological process using three case studies, and consider some ways that this issue might be addressed.},

Both Plants and LayerSets contain various fuel particles (leaves, needles, twigs) with various properties including shape, size and surface area to volume ratio. A wide range of vegetation and treatments can be modeled, analyzed quantitatively and visualized in a 3D viewer. We describe the modeling approach and demonstrate fuel modeling at different levels of detail, fuel treatment and fire effects capabilities. Detailed model equations are provided in the Appendices.},

  abstract = {Modeling wildfire activity is crucial for informing science-based risk management and understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of fire-prone ecosystems worldwide. Models help disentangle the relative influences of different factors, understand wildfire predictability, and provide insights into specific events. Here, we develop Firelihood, a two-component, Bayesian, hierarchically structured, probabilistic model of daily fire activity, which is modeled as the outcome of a marked point process: individual fires are the points (occurrence component), and fire sizes are the marks (size component). The space-time Poisson model for occurrence is adjusted to gridded fire counts using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) combined with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. The size model is based on piecewise-estimated Pareto and generalized Pareto distributions, adjusted with INLA. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) and forest area are the main explanatory variables. Temporal and spatial residuals are included to improve the consistency of the relationship between weather and fire occurrence. The posterior distribution of the Bayesian model provided 1,000 replications of fire activity that were compared with observations at various temporal and spatial scales in Mediterranean France. The number of fires larger than 1 ha across the region was coarsely reproduced at the daily scale, and was more accurately predicted on a weekly basis or longer. The regional weekly total number of larger fires (10\textendash 100 ha) was predicted as well, but the accuracy degraded with size, as the model uncertainty increased with event rareness. Local predictions of fire numbers or burned areas also required a longer aggregation period to maintain model accuracy. The estimation of fires larger than 1 ha was also consistent with observations during the extreme fire season of the 2003 unprecedented heat wave, but the model systematically underrepresented large fires and burned areas, which suggests that the FWI does not consistently rate the actual danger of large fire occurrence during heat waves. Firelihood enabled a novel analysis of the stochasticity underlying fire hazard, and offers a variety of applications, including fire hazard predictions for management and projections in the context of climate change.},

It has been qualitatively validated in its ability to simulate fire behavior, but there is still a need to validate physical submodels separately. In the present study, the dynamics and turbulence of the flow simulated by FIRETEC are validated in a manner similar to other air-flow models without fire, through comparison with measurements associated with flows within continuous and discontinuous forests captured through in situ and wind-tunnel experiments with neutral thermal stratification. The model is shown to be able to reproduce accurately all essential features of turbulent flow over both forests. Moreover, a short sensitivity study shows that the model is not very sensitive to uncertain parameters such as vegetation drag coefficient. Finally, it is shown in the discontinuous forest case that wind gusts on fuel-breaks can be very strong and significantly higher than in surrounding canopies, even if their directions are more stable. These results and others briefly reviewed in the present paper allow better understanding of wind-flow perturbations induced by fuel-breaks. This new validation added to previous ones confirms the ability of FIRETEC for investigating effects of fuel-break design on fire propagation.},

However, field evidence linking LFMC to fire behaviour are very limited, despite numerous field experiments. In this study, we reanalyse a shrubland fire dataset with a special focus on LFMC to investigate this counterintuitive outcome. We found that this controversy might result from three causes. First, the range of experimental LFMC data was too moist to reveal a significant effect with the widespread exponential or power functions. Indeed, LFMC exhibited a strong effect below 100\%, but marginal above this threshold, contrary to these functions. Second, we found that the LFMC significance was unlikely when the number of fire experiments was smaller than 40. Finally, an analysis suggested that 10 to 15\% measurement error \textendash{} arising from the estimation of environmental variables from field measurements \textendash{} could lead to an underestimation by 30\% of the LFMC effect. The LFMC effect in field experiments is thus stronger than previously reported in the range of LFMC occurring during the French fire season and in accordance with observations at different scales. This highlights the need to improve our understanding of the relationship between LFMC and fire behaviour to refine fire-danger predictions.},

We model material properties, such as moisture and charring behavior, and associate them with individual particles. The combustion is efficiently processed in the surface domain of the tree model on a polygonal mesh. A user can dynamically interact with the model by initiating fires and by inducing stress on branches. The flames realistically propagate through the tree model by consuming the available resources. Our method runs at interactive rates and supports multiple tree instances in parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerous examples and evaluate its plausibility against the combustion of real wood samples.},

Thinned stands displayed enhanced metrics of tree vigor, growth, and mechanical stability, thereby improving response to future restoration treatments and broadening the range of potential stand conditions.

  abstract = {In recent years finite-mixture models have been employed to approximate and model empirical diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions. We used two-component mixtures of either the Weibull distribution or the gamma distribution for describing the DBH distributions of mixed-species, two-cohort forest stands, to analyse the relationships between the DBH components, age cohorts and dominant species, and to assess the significance of differences between the mixture distributions and the kernel density estimates. The data consisted of plots from the \'Swi\k{e}tokrzyski National Park (Central Poland) and areas close to and including the North Carolina section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (USA; southern Appalachians). The fit of the mixture Weibull model to empirical DBH distributions had a precision similar to that of the mixture gamma model, slightly less accurate estimate was obtained with the kernel density estimator. Generally, in the two-cohort, two-storied, multi-species stands in the southern Appalachians, the two-component DBH structure was associated with age cohort and dominant species. The 1st DBH component of the mixture model was associated with the 1st dominant species sp1 occurred in young age cohort (e.g., sweetgum, eastern hemlock); and to a lesser degree, the 2nd DBH component was associated with the 2nd dominant species sp2 occurred in old age cohort (e.g., loblolly pine, red maple). In two-cohort, partly multilayered, stands in the \'Swi\k{e}tokrzyski National Park, the DBH structure was usually associated with only age cohorts (two dominant species often occurred in both young and old age cohorts). When empirical DBH distributions representing stands of complex structure are approximated using mixture models, the convergence of the estimation process is often significantly dependent on the starting strategies. Depending on the number of DBHs measured, three methods for choosing the initial values are recommended: min.k/max.k, 0.5/1.5/mean, and multistart. For large samples (number of DBHs measured {$\geqslant$}80) the multistage method is proposed \textendash{} for the two-component mixture Weibull or gamma model select initial values using the min.k/max.k (for k=1,5,10) and 0.5/1.5/mean methods, run the numerical procedure for each method, and when no two solutions are the same, apply the multistart method also.},

Forest fires are one of the major environmental concerns, economic, and social in the worldwide. The aim of current research is to identify general indicators influencing on forest fire and compare forest fire susceptibility maps based on the boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized additive model (GAM), and random forest (RF) data mining models in the Minudasht Township, Golestan Province, Iran. According to expert opinion and literature review, fifteen condition factors on forest fire have been selected in the study area. These are slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), plan curvature, wind effect, annual temperature and rainfall, soil texture, distance to roads, rivers, and villages, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land use. Forest fire locations were identified using MODIS images, historical records, and extensive field checking. 106 ({$\approx$}70\%) locations, out of 151 forest fires identified, were used for models building/training, while the remaining 45 ({$\approx$}30\%) cases were used for the models validation. BRT, GAM, and RF data mining models were used to distinguish between presence and absence of forest fires and its mapping. These algorithms were used to perform feature selection in order to reveal the variables that contribute more to forest fire occurrence. Finally, for validation of models, the area under the curve (AUC) for forest fire susceptibility maps was calculated. The validation of results showed that AUC for three mentioned models varies from 0.7279 to 0.8770 (AUCBRT=80.84\%, AUCGAM=87.70\%, and AUCRF=72.79\%,). Results indicated that the main drivers of forest fire occurrence were annual rainfall, distance to roads, and land use factors. The results can be applied to primary warning, fire suppression resource planning, and allocation work.},

  abstract = {Fire is a major component of the disturbance regime and a critical determinant of competitive outcomes in many ecosystems. In forests dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), fire was frequent and ubiquitous prior to European settlement, but fires have been exceedingly small and rare over the last 70\textendash 80 years because of aggressive fire prevention and suppression policies. As a result, many aspects of redwood fire ecology remain poorly understood. However, in 2008 a single storm ignited numerous fires throughout the redwood region, providing a rare opportunity to conduct replicated fire effects research. One year post-fire, we investigated competitive dynamics by quantifying bole survival and basal sprouting, for redwood and associated species, at four field sites that spanned much of the latitudinal range of redwood and encompassed (1) second-growth and old-growth stands, (2) burned and unburned areas, and (3) a wide range of fire severities. We employed a mixed effects analytical framework and found that: (1) the probability of bole survival was greater for redwood than for its primary competitor (tanoak; Notholithocarpus densiflorus), (2) this divergence was much more pronounced at higher fire severities, and (3) tanoak exhibited a slight advantage in terms of post-fire basal sprouting, but the dominance of tanoak basal sprouts in burned areas was reduced relative to unburned areas. For many disturbance types in many ecosystems, the empirical data necessary for effective management decisions are lacking, and studies incorporating vegetative tree regeneration are especially scarce. Our work demonstrates the importance of utilizing unique field research opportunities to test current theories, while unequivocally documenting that fires of all severities increased the abundance of redwood relative to tanoak, and that higher severity fires more strongly favored redwood.},

  abstract = {Fire effects are modeled for a variety of reasons including: to evaluate risk, to develop treatment prescriptions, to compare management options, and to understand ecosystems. Fire effects modeling may be conducted at a range of temporal and spatial scales. First-order fire effects are those that are the direct result of the combustion process such as plant injury and death, fuel consumption and smoke production. Modeling these effects provides an important cornerstone for models that operate at larger spatial and temporal scales. Detailed physical models of heat transfer and the combustion process under development should provide a vehicle for quantifying fire treatment and predicting fire effects. Second-order fire effects are indirect consequences of fire and other post-fire interactions such as weather. They may take place a few hours to many decades after a fire. Some important secondorder fire effects are smoke dispersion, erosion, and vegetation succession. Many approaches have been used to model fire effects including empirical, mechanistic, stochastic, and combinations of all three. Selection of the appropriate model approach and scale depends on the objectives of the modeler, as well as the quality and quantity of available data. This paper is not meant to provide an exhaustive review of fire effects models. Instead, it presents a background in approaches to modeling fire effects to provide managers a basis for selecting and interpreting simulation tools.},

  abstract = {Extreme drought stress and associated bark beetle population growth contributed to an extensive tree mortality event in California, USA, resulting in more than 129 million trees dying between 2012 and 2016. Although drought is an important driver of this mortality event, past and ongoing fire suppression and the consequent densification of forests may have contributed. In some areas, land management agencies have worked to reduce stand density through mechanical treatments and prescribed fire to restore forests to less dense, more open conditions that are presumably more resilient to disturbance and changing climate. Here, we evaluate if stand structural conditions associated with treated (e.g., thinned and prescribed burned) forests in the Sierra Nevada of California conferred more resistance to the bark beetle epidemic and drought event of 2012\textendash 2016. We found that, compared to untreated units, treated units had lower stand densities, larger average tree diameters, and greater dominance of pines (Pinus), the historically dominant trees. For all tree species studied, mortality was substantially greater in climatically drier areas (i.e., lower elevations and latitudes). Both pine species studied (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa] and sugar pine [Pinus lambertiana]) had greater mortality in areas where their diameters were larger, suggesting a size preference for their insect mortality agents. For ponderosa pine, the tree species experiencing greatest mortality, individual-tree mortality probability (for a given tree diameter) was significantly lower in treated stands. Ponderosa pine mortality was also positively related to density of medium- to large-sized conspecific trees, especially in areas with lower precipitation, suggesting that abundance of nearby host trees for insect mortality agents was an important determinant of pine mortality. Mortality of incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and white fir (Abies concolor) was positively associated with basal area, suggesting sensitivity to competition during drought, but overall mortality was lower, likely because the most prevalent and effective mortality agents (the bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. ponderosae) are associated specifically with pine species within our study region. Our findings suggest that forest thinning treatments are effective in reducing drought-related tree mortality in forests, and they underscore the important interaction between water and forest density in mediating bark beetle-caused mortality.},

To capture this variability, we designed the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a national system to create fuelbeds and classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. This paper describes the structure of the fuelbeds internal to FCCS. Fuelbeds are considered relatively homogeneous units on the landscape, representing distinct combustion environments that determine potential fire behaviour and effects. The FCCS fuelbeds are organized into six strata: canopy, shrubs, nonwoody fuels, woody fuels, litter\textendash lichen\textendash moss, and ground fuels. Fuelbeds are described by several qualitative and quantitative physical and biological variables with emphasis on characteristics useful for fuels management and fire behaviour planning. The FCCS includes 216 fuelbeds that represent the major vegetation types of the United States. The FCCS fuelbeds can be used as presented or modified to create customized fuelbeds with general or site-specific data to address fire science management or research questions. This system allows resource managers to evaluate wildland fuels operations and management activities, fire hazard, and ecological and air quality impacts at small and large spatial scales. The FCCS fuelbeds represent the United States, although the system has the potential for building fuelbeds for international application.},

Rate of spread is developed from field data correlated to predictions of Rothermel's surface fire spread model. Energy release from surface fuels is obtained from Albini's burnout model. Fireline intensity is estimated from Byram's model. Flame lengths are estimated from Thomas' model. Energy rate, or power developed by the fire and ambient wind, is developed from Byram's equations and used to ascertain the possibility of a wind-driven or plume-dominated fire. The characteristics of these fires and dangers to fire fighters are discussed. A simple elliptical model is developed for estimating the area and perimeter of a large fire. The paper is oriented for use by well-trained fire behavior analysts to use in the fieldwithout the aid of computers to assess the characteristics of running crown fires.},

Field data were compared with data predicted using the most used crown fire spread models. A small-scale experiment was developed with Pinus pinaster trees to evaluate the role of convection in crown fire initiation. Mass loss calorimeter tests were conducted with P. pinea needles to estimate residence time of the flame, which was used to validate the crown fire spread model.Main results: The commonly used crown fire models underestimated the crown fire spread rate observed in the full-scale experiment, but the proposed new integrated approach yielded better fits. Without wind-forced convection, tree crowns did not ignite until flames from an intense surface fire contacted tree foliage. Bench-scale tests based on radiation heat flux therefore offer a limited insight to full-scale phenomena.Research highlights: Existing crown fire behaviour models may underestimate the rate of spread of crown fires in many Mediterranean ecosystems. New bench-scale methods based on flame buoyancy and more crown field experiments allowing detailed measurements of fire behaviour are needed.},

Models for estimating crown profile in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were developed from attributes of individual whorl branches, including basal diameter, total length, angle of origin, and height from ground. The prediction system consisted of four equations to predict whorl branch basal diameter, branch length, branch angle of origin, and corresponding crown radius. The system is entered with three standard individual tree measurements: diameter at breast height (DBH), total height, and height to crown base. Four approaches were developed for modeling crown profile with this system of equations, distinguished by parameter estimation method, modeling data subset, and the specific form by which whorl branch diameter was represented (mean vs maximum diameter). A system-of-equations parameter-estimation technique (modified three-stage least squares) was applied to account for the correlation of error terms across the equations, and this procedure was compared with ordinary and nonlinear least squares methods. The resulting crown profile prediction systems were evaluated under both theoretical and empirical criteria. The recommended system appears to perform well against validation data on both an equation (branch) level and system (crown profile) level.},

  abstract = {The diverse vegetation types and carbon pools of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) are tightly coupled to fire regimes that depend on climate and fire suppression. To realistically assess the effects of twenty-first-century climate change on PNW fire and carbon dynamics, we developed a new fire suppression rule for the MC1 dynamic general vegetation model that we ran under three climate change scenarios. Climate projections from the CSIRO Mk3, MIROC 3.2 medres, and Hadley CM3 general circulation models, forced by the A2 CO2 emissions scenario, were downscaled to a 30 arc-second ({$\sim$}0.6 km2) grid. Future climates amplify the already strong seasonality of temperature and precipitation across the domain. Simulations displayed large increases in area burned (76\%\textendash 310\%) and burn severities (29\%\textendash 41\%) by the end of the twenty-first century. The relatively dry ecosystems east of the Cascades gain carbon in the future despite projections of more intense wildfires, while the mesic maritime forests lose up to 1.2 Pg C from increased burning. Simulated fire suppression causes overall carbon gains yet leaves ecosystems vulnerable to large future fires. Overall, our simulations suggest the Pacific Northwest has the potential to sequester {$\sim$}1 Pg C over the next century unless summer droughts severely intensify fire regimes.},

New techniques, both field sampling and remote sensing, that capture vegetation fuel type, biomass, and volume at super fine-scales (cm to dm) in three-dimensions (3D) are critical to advancing forest fuel and wildland fire science. Such scales are particularly important for some computational fluid dynamics fire behavior models that operate in 3D and have implications for wildland fire operations and fire effects research. This study describes the coupling of new 3D field sampling data with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to infer fine-scale fuel mass in 3D. We found that there are strong relationships between fine-scale mass and TLS occupied volume, porosity, and surface area, which were used to develop fine-scale prediction equations using TLS across vegetative fuel types, namely grasses and shrubs. The application of this novel 3D sampling technique to high resolution TLS data in this study represents an advancement in producing inputs for computational fluid dynamics fire behavior models that will improve understanding fire-vegetation feedbacks in highly managed fire-dependent ecosystems.},

Describing fuelbeds 3Dly is critical in determining vertical and horizontal distributions of fuel elements and the mass, especially in frequently burned pine ecosystems where fine-scale fuels arrangement drives fire intensity and resulting fire effects. Here, we describe research involving the use of highly resolved 3D models. We create fuelbeds using individual grass, litter, and pinecone models designed from field measurements. These fuel models are distributed throughout the fuelbed to replicate fuel distribution in rectified nadir photography taken for each plot. The simulated fuelbeds are converted into voxel arrays and biomass is estimated from calculated surface area between mesh vertices for each voxel. We compare field-based fuel depth and biomass with simulated estimates to demonstrate similarities and differences. Biomass distributions between simulated fuel beds and terrestrial laser scan data correlated well using Weibull shape parameters (r = 0.86). Our findings indicate that integration of field, simulated, and terrestrial laser scanner data will improve characterization of fuel mass, type, and spatial allocations that are important inputs to physics-based fire behavior models.},

  abstract = {Yellow pine and mixed-conifer (YPMC) forests are the predominant montane forest type in the Sierra Nevada, southern Cascade Range, and neighboring forested areas on the Modoc and Inyo National Forests (the ``assessment area''). YPMC forests occur above the oak woodland belt and below red fir forests, and are dominated by the yellow pines (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa Lawson \& C. Lawson] and Jeffrey pine [Pinus jeffreyi Balf.]); white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. \& Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.); sugar pine (P. lambertiana Douglas); incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin); and black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newberry), along with a number of other hardwood and conifer species. We conducted an indepth assessment of the natural range of variation (NRV) of YPMC forests for the assessment area, focusing on ecosystem processes and forest structure from historical data sources from pre-Euro-American settlement times (16th through mid-19th centuries) and current reference forests (YPMC forests that have retained frequent fire and have suffered little human degradation), and comparing current conditions to the NRV. The Mediterranean climate of the assessment area, modified by strong latitudinal, topographic, and elevational gradients, plays an important role in shaping the structure and composition of YPMC forests. Fire was an historically important ecosystem process that occurred frequently, generally burned at low to moderate severity, created a heterogeneous forest structure at a fine spatial scale, and maintained pine dominance in many stands that would otherwise undergo succession to more shade-tolerant fir and cedar species. Forest structure at larger spatial scales was highly variable but was characterized mostly by relatively low tree densities, large tree sizes, high seedling mortality as a result of recurrent fire, and highly heterogeneous understory structure that could include locally abundant fire-stimulated shrub species. Following Euro-American settlement, wholesale changes occurred in YPMC forests in the assessment area, principally because of extensive logging followed by a century of highly effective fire suppression. Modern YPMC forests have departed from NRV conditions for a wide range of ecosystem processes and structural attributes. There is strong consensus among published studies that, on average, modern YPMC stands have much higher densities dominated by smaller trees (often of shade-tolerant species), much longer fire-return intervals, and les area burned across the landscape compared to reference YPMC forests. In addition, fires that escape initial attack are much larger and higher severity on average than the average pre-Euro-American settlement fire. There is more moderate consensus among published studies that the average modern YPMC stand in the assessment supports greater fuels and deeper forest litter, higher canopy cover and fewer canopy gaps, more coarse woody debris, a higher density of snags, and experiences a longer fire season compared to reference YPMC forests. Among the variables assessed, only basal area, overall plant species richness, and percentage cover of grass/forbs and shrubs appear to be within or near the NRV.

  abstract = {Mapping aboveground forest biomass is of fundamental importance for estimating CO2 emissions due to land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon. However, existing biomass maps for this region diverge in terms of the total biomass estimates derived, as well as in the spatial patterns of mapped biomass. In addition, no regional or location-specific measure of reliability accompanies most of these maps. In this study, 330 one-hectare plots from the RADAMBRASIL survey, acquired over and along areas adjacent to the state of Rond\^onia, were used to generate a biomass map over the entire region using geostatistics. The RADAMBRASIL samples were used to generate a biomass map, along with a measure of reliability for each biomass estimate at each location, using kriging with external drift with elevation, vegetation type and soil texture considered as biomass predictor variables. Cross-validation was performed using the sample plots to compare the performance of kriging against a simple biomass estimation using the sample mean. Overall, biomass varied from 225 to 486Mgha-1, with a local standard deviation ranging from 62 to 202Mgha-1. Large uncertainty values were obtained for regions with low sampling density, in particular in savanna areas. The geostatistical method adopted in this paper has the potential to be applied over the entire Brazilian Amazon region to provide more accurate local estimates of biomass, which would aid carbon flux estimation, along with measures of their reliability, and to identify areas where more sampling efforts should be concentrated.},

These tissues have been assessed independently, but the relative significance of the xylem and cambium is still uncertain. The goal of this study is to evaluate the xylem dysfunction hypothesis and cambium necrosis hypothesis simultaneously. The hot dry conditions of a low severity fire were simulated in a drying oven, exposing Sequoia sempervirens shoots to 70\textdegree C and 100\textdegree C for 6-60~minutes. Cambial viability was measured with Neutral Red stain and water transport capacity was assessed by calculating the loss of hydraulic conductivity. Vulnerability curves were also constructed to determine susceptibility to drought-induced embolism following heat exposure. The vascular cambium died completely at 100\textdegree C after only 6~minutes of heat exposure, while cells remained viable at 70\textdegree C temperatures for up to 15~minutes. Sixty minutes of exposure to 70\textdegree C reduced stem hydraulic conductivity by 40\%, while 45~minutes at 100\textdegree C caused complete loss of conductivity. The heat treatments dropped hydraulic conductivity irrecoverably but did not significantly impact post-fire vulnerability to embolism. Overall, the damaging effects of high temperature occurred more rapidly in the vascular cambium than xylem following heat exposure. Importantly, the xylem remained functional until the most extreme treatments, far after the vascular cambium has died. Our results suggest that the viability of the vascular cambium may be more critical to post-fire survival than xylem function in S. sempervirens. Given the complexity of fire, we recommend ground-truthing the cambial and xylem post-fire response on a diverse range of species.},

The Fire and Environmental Research Applications Team (FERA) of the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, is developing a national system of fuel characteristic classification (FCC). The system is designed to accommodate researchers and managers operating at a variety of scales, and who have access to a variety of kinds of input data. Users can generate fuel characteristics by accessing existing fuelbed descriptions (fuelbed prototypes) using generic information such as cover type or vegetation form. Fuelbed prototypes will provide the best available predictions of the kind, quality and abundance of fuels. Users can accept these default settings or modify some or all of them using more detailed information about vegetation structure and fuel biomass. When the user has completed editing the fuelbed data, the FCC system calculates or infers quantitative fuel characteristics (physical, chemical, and structural properties) and probable fire parameters specific to that fuelbed. Each user-described fuelbed is also assigned to one of approximately 192 stylized fuel characteristic classes.},

The formulation may be used to compare potential fire behavior between fuelbeds that differ in time, space, or as a result of management, and provides a means to classify and map fuelbeds based on their expected surface fire behavior under any set of defined environmental conditions (i.e., effective wind speed and fuel moisture content). Model reformulation preserves the basic mathematical framework of the Rothermel fire spread model, reinterprets data from two of the original basic equations in his model, and offers a new conceptual formulation that allows the direct use of inventoried fuel properties instead of stylized fuel models. Alternative methods for calculating the effect of wind speed and fuel moisture, based on more recent literature, are also provided.

Growing awareness of fire weather, when combined with related experience on fires, can develop into increasingly intuitive, rapid, and accurate applications.

Links among existing mathematical models of fire behavior are used to develop two indices of crown fire hazard\textemdash the Torching Index and Crowning Index. These indices can be used to ordinate different forest stands by their relative susceptibility to crown fire and to compare the effectiveness of crown fire mitigation treatments. The coupled model was used to simulate the wide range of fire behavior possible in a forest stand, from a low-intensity surface fire to a high-intensity active crown fire, for the purpose of comparing potential fire behavior. The hazard indices and behavior simulations incorporate the effects of surface fuel characteristics, dead and live fuel moistures (surface and crown), slope steepness, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and wind reduction by the canopy. Example simulations are for western Montana Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta stands. Although some of the models presented here have had limited testing or restricted geographic applicability, the concepts will apply to models for other regions and new models with greater geographic applicability.},

  abstract = {Ancient giant sequoias Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) J. Buchholz are highly valued trees with limited distribution. They are the most massive trees on earth, and they have exceptional longevity ({$>$}3,000~years). Given their extraordinary resilience to wildfire, insects, and disease, most managers hoped giant sequoias would be resistant to anthropogenic change. However, the warming climate and fire exclusion-caused fuel build-up has dramatically increased the amount of high-intensity wildfire in giant sequoia groves since 2015. To better understand recent wildfire effects on large, legacy giant sequoia trees, we surveyed high- and moderate-severity fire areas in groves that burned in three wildfires between 2015 and 2017. Within areas classified as high severity via remote sensing, {$\sim$}84\% of the 162 large sequoias ({$>$}1.2~m diameter at breast height) were killed; in moderate severity, {$\sim$}28\% of the 239 large sequoias were killed. These rates varied between fires but overall were at the lower end of the mortality range that has been documented in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. Across all three fire areas, we found large sequoia mortality was linked with presence of significant prior fire damage to the lower tree bole (i.e., fire scars or ``catfaces''), lower crown ratios, and lower elevations. At Black Mountain Grove, we tracked trees through time and found total crown damage and the presence of fire scars were the best predictors of mortality by year three, where large sequoias sustained up to~{$\sim~$}85\% crown damage before succumbing to injury. There, 52 of 204 trees were dead one-year postfire, with 71 dead by year three. Overall, these fires caused significant and concerning mortality levels of these ancient trees, and yet the impact on sequoia groves between 2015 and 2017 was dwarfed in comparison to the more recent 2020 Castle Fire, 2021 Windy Fire and 2021 KNP Complex Fire. With the push to increase forest and fuel treatments to reduce catastrophic fire risk across the Western U.S., more immediate triage to protect irreplaceable resources is needed as fire activity rapidly increases. Our study suggests that prioritizing management action that creates fire resilience in unburned groves, and maintains the fuel reduction benefits accrued by past treatments and lower severity wildfires, will be critical to avoid continued losses of these exceptional, irreplaceable old growth forests.},

We obtained loading values for six fuel components using five fuel load sampling techniques at five locations in western Montana, USA. The techniques included fixed-area plots, planar intersect, photoloads, a photoload macroplot, and a photo series. For each of the six fuels, we compared (1) the relative differences in load values among techniques and (2) the differences in load between each method and a reference sample. Totals from each method were rated for how much they deviated from totals for the reference in each fuel category. The planar-intersect method, which used 2.50 km of transects, was rated best overall for assessing the six fuels. Bootstrapping showed that at least 1.50 km of transect were needed to obtain estimates that approximate the reference sample. A newly developed photoload method, which compared fuel conditions on the forest floor with sets of pictures calibrated for load by fuel type, compared well with the reference and planar intersect. The commonly used photo series consistently produced higher mean load estimates than any other method for total fine woody debris (0.05\textendash 0.20 kg m-2) and logs (0.50\textendash 1.25 kg m-2).},

Here we develop new allometric equations for these forests based on 44 trees 23\textendash 84\,m tall, which can be used to estimate leaf, bark, cambium, sapwood, and heartwood quantities, including biomass and carbon content, from ground-based measurements of trunk diameter, height, and crown size. New equations complement those already available for S. sempervirens in young and old-growth forests and should be applied judiciously. We use fixed area plots in a 159-year-old second-growth forest (0.5\,ha) and a primary forest with trees {$>$}1100\,years old (1.0\,ha) to compare three sets of equations. Whereas equations from young forests underestimate biomass in older forests, new equations underestimate trunk and overestimate branch quantities in the old-growth forest, and equations from old-growth forests do the opposite in the mature second-growth forest. Despite the great age difference, canopy structure of these low-elevation, alluvial forests is similar with S. sempervirens stratified into dominant and subordinate crown classes towering above a diminutive understory. Dendrochronological reconstruction of heights and wood radii for nine individuals reveal that both forests have trees producing {$>$}300\,kg\,yr-1 with tall trees in the old-growth forest producing up to 800\,kg\,yr-1 in recent decades. Sequoia sempervirens represents nearly 100\% of biomass and 83 to \textendash 92\% of leaf area in the second-growth (total LAI\,=\,15.0) and old-growth (total LAI\,=\,19.3) forests, respectively. The best allometric equations estimate that the second-growth forest holds 1667\,Mg\,ha-1 of aboveground biomass (837\,Mg\,C\,ha-1), 56\% of which is heartwood, whereas the old-growth forest holds 4595\,Mg\,ha-1 of aboveground biomass (2332\,Mg\,C\,ha-1), 76\% of which is heartwood. Restoration management has potential to harness the carbon sequestration potential of S. sempervirens by promoting heartwood accumulation through silviculture.},

We climbed 140 trees in old-growth redwood forests across California, USA, spanning a broad range of sizes and including the tallest, largest, and oldest known living individuals (i.e., 115.86 vs. 96.29 m tall, 424 vs. 582 Mg aboveground dry mass, and 2510 vs. 3240 years old for Sequoia and Sequoiadendron, respectively). We used a combination of direct measurements, hierarchical sampling, and dendrochronology to quantify tree structure and annual growth increments through old age. We also developed equations to predict aboveground attributes of standing redwoods via ground-based measurements. Compared to Sequoia, Sequoiadendron develops thicker bark on lower trunks, provisions leaves with more sapwood, and delays heartwood production throughout the crown. Main trunk wood volume growth (up to 1.6 vs. 0.9 m3/yr), aboveground biomass growth (up to 0.77 vs. 0.45 Mg/yr), and aboveground growth efficiency (0.55 {$\pm$} 0.04 vs. 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.01 kg annual growth per kg leaves, mean {$\pm$} SE) are all higher in Sequoia. Two independent dimensions of structure\textemdash size and aboveground vigor\textemdash are the strongest predictors of tree-level productivity in both species. A third dimension, relative trunk size, is a significant predictor of growth in Sequoia such that trees with relatively large main trunks compared to their crowns produce more wood annually. Similar-size trees grow at similar rates regardless of latitude or elevation in tall forests of each species. Recent annual growth increments are higher than in the past for the majority of trees, and old trees are just as responsive to environmental changes as young trees. Negative growth\textendash age relationships in previous centuries and positive growth\textendash age relationships in recent decades reflect sampling bias and shifting disturbance regimes. Overall, we find little (if any) evidence for negative effects of old age on tree-level productivity in either species. Except for recovery periods following temporary reductions in crown size, annual increments of wood volume and biomass growth increase as redwoods enlarge with age until extrinsic forces cause tree death.},

LiDAR-derived height profiles were also generated in 1-m layers, and regressed on CBD estimates calculated for 1-m layers from field plots to predict three-dimensional canopy fuel loading. We then produced maps of canopy fuel metrics for three 9km2 forested areas in the Pinelands. Correlations for standard LiDAR-derived parameters between the two LiDAR systems were all highly significant, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.82 and 0.98. Stepwise linear regression models developed from the profiling LiDAR data predicted maximum CBD and CFW (r2=0.94 and 0.92) better than those developed from the scanning LiDAR data (r2=0.83 and 0.71, respectively). A single regression for the prediction of CBD at all canopy layers had r2 values of 0.93 and 0.82 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Individual bin regressions for predicting CBD at each canopy height layer were also highly significant at most canopy heights, with r2 values for each layer ranging between 0.36 and 0.89, and 0.44 and 0.99 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Relationships were poorest mid-canopy, where highest average values and highest variability in fuel loading occurred. Fit of data to Gaussian distributions of canopy height profiles facilitated a simpler expression of these parameters for analysis and mapping purposes, with overall r2 values of 0.86 and 0.92 for the profiling and scanning LiDAR datasets, respectively. Our research demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to generate accurate, three-dimensional representations of canopy structure and fuel loading at high spatial resolution by linking 1-m return height profiles to biometric estimates from field plots.},

  abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are a gridded representation of the surface of the Earth and typically contain uncertainties due to data collection and processing. Slope and aspect estimates on a DEM contain errors and uncertainties inherited from the representation of a continuous surface as a grid (referred to as truncation error; TE) and from any DEM uncertainty. We analyze in detail the impacts of TE and propagated elevation uncertainty (PEU) on slope and aspect.  Using synthetic data as a control, we define functions to quantify both TE and PEU for arbitrary grids. We then develop a quality metric which captures the combined impact of both TE and PEU on the calculation of topographic metrics. Our quality metric allows us to examine the spatial patterns of error and uncertainty in topographic metrics and to compare calculations on DEMs of different sizes and accuracies.  Using lidar data with point density of {$\sim$}10\&thinsp;pts\&thinsp;m-2 covering Santa Cruz Island in southern California, we are able to generate DEMs and uncertainty estimates at several grid resolutions. Slope (aspect) errors on the 1\&thinsp;m dataset are on average 0.3{$\circ$} (0.9{$\circ$}) from TE and 5.5{$\circ$} (14.5{$\circ$}) from PEU. We calculate an optimal DEM resolution for our SCI lidar dataset of 4\&thinsp;m that minimizes the error bounds on topographic metric calculations due to the combined influence of TE and PEU for both slope and aspect calculations over the entire SCI. Average slope (aspect) errors from the 4\&thinsp;m DEM are 0.25{$\circ$} (0.75{$\circ$}) from TE and 5{$\circ$} (12.5{$\circ$}) from PEU. While the smallest grid resolution possible from the high-density SCI lidar is not necessarily optimal for calculating topographic metrics, high point-density data are essential for measuring DEM uncertainty across a range of resolutions.},

  abstract = {Climate change is projected to exacerbate the intensity of heat waves and drought, leading to a greater incidence of large and high-intensity wildfires in forested ecosystems. Predicting responses of seedlings to such fires requires a process-based understanding of how the energy released during fires affects plant physiology and mortality. Understanding what fire `doses' cause seedling mortality is important for maintaining grasslands or promoting establishment of desirable plant species. We conducted controlled laboratory combustion experiments on replicates of well-watered nursery-grown seedlings. We evaluated the growth, mortality and physiological response of Larix occidentalis and Pinus contorta seedlings to increasing fire radiative energy density (FRED) doses created using natural fuels with known combustion properties. We observed a general decline in the size and physiological performance of both species that scaled with increasing FRED dose, including decreases in leaf-level photosynthesis, seedling leaf area and diameter at root collar. Greater FRED dose increased the recovery time of chlorophyll fluorescence in the remaining needles. This study provides preliminary data on what level of FRED causes mortality in these two species, which can aid land managers in identifying strategies to maintain (or eliminate) woody seedlings of interest.},

Although many authors have highlighted limitations of this approach and called for improved assessments of severity, others have suggested that the operational utility of such a simple approach makes it acceptable. An alternative pathway to evaluate fire severity that bridges fire combustion dynamics and ecophysiology via dose\textendash response experiments is presented. We provide an illustrative example from a controlled nursery combustion laboratory experiment. In this example, severity is defined through changes in the ability of the plant to assimilate carbon at the leaf level. We also explore changes in the Differenced Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (dNDVI) and the Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) as intermediate spectral indices. We demonstrate the potential of this methodology and propose dose\textendash response metrics for quantifying severity in terms of carbon cycle processes.},

  abstract = {Following 20th century logging, much of the natural coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D.Don.] Endl.) range consists of dense second-growth stands with slow tree growth and low biodiversity. There is a landscape-scale effort in much of coastal northern California to increase tree growth rates and ecosystem biodiversity via thinning treatments, thereby hopefully accelerating the development of old-growth forest characteristics. Red\- wood National Park has been experimenting with thinning in these forest types since the 1970s. This study investigated short- (1 year post-thinning) and long-term (40 years post-thinning) responses of redwood physi\- ology (water potential and stomatal conductance), redwood growth (via tree-rings), and forest biodiversity (understory plants, birds, and mammals) to restoration thinning treatments. We found that thinning secondgrowth redwood forests with 40\% basal area reduction treatments 1) did not meaningfully influence tree water potential, 2) increased tree stomatal conductance in the short-term, 3) increased tree growth in the longterm, 4) increased understory plant diversity, and 5) did not affect bird or mammal diversity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that thinning second-growth redwood forests has the potential to accelerate the develop\- ment of old-growth characteristics. This verification of the efficacy of restoration treatments is important in\- formation for land managers, as plans are currently underway to apply these treatments at the landscape-scale. This study can provide useful baseline data to aid future assessments of long-term forest responses to contem\- porary restoration efforts.},

The primary objective of this study was to develop an efficient modeling approach to describe the 3-dimensional, hierarchical structure of individual crown shells within stands and corresponding canopy patches. Crown shells were modeled based on crown ratio, maximum cardinal radius, vertical position, and shape. Canopies were represented by adding unique crowns to simulated point patterns of trees of known aggregation as measured by Pielou's index of nonrandomness. Canopy patches were delineated at multiple horizontal and vertical scales using the ARC/INFO geographic information system (GIS). The patterns of canopy patches are clearly variable and scale dependent. Canopy patterns become more diverse at broader horizontal scales, and change greatly from the lower to the upper canopies. The modeling approach used in this study has general utility in characterizing 3-dimensional canopies of many types of forests. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Using a recently published algorithm that relates the density, size, and species of individual trees to the height distribution of first returns, we estimated parameters that succinctly describe SDDs that are most consistent with each 0.25-ha LiDAR tile across a 30,000 ha forest landscape. Tests with independent validation plots showed that the diameter distribution of stems was predicted with reasonable accuracy in most cases (half of validation plots had R2 {$\geq$} 0.75, and another 23\% had 0.5 {$\leq$} R2 {$<$} 0.75). The predicted frequency of larger stems was much better than that of small stems (8 {$\leq$} x {$<$} 11 cm diameter), particularly small conifers. We used the predicted SDDs to calculate aboveground carbon density (ACD; RMSE = 21.4 Mg C/ha), quadratic mean diameter (RMSE = 3.64 cm), basal area (RMSE = 6.99 m2/ha) and stem number (RMSE = 272 stems/ha). The accuracy of our predictions compared favorably with previous studies that have generally been undertaken in simpler conifer-dominated forest types. We demonstrate the utility of our results to spatial forest management planning by mapping SDDs, the proportion of broadleaves, and ACD at a 0.25 ha resolution.},

However, defining such models and their parameters is a difficult task. We propose an inverse modelling approach for stochastic trees that takes polygonal tree models as input and estimates the parameters of a procedural model so that it produces trees similar to the input. Our framework is based on a novel parametric model for tree generation and uses Monte Carlo Markov Chains to find the optimal set of parameters. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of input models obtained from different sources, such as interactive modelling systems, reconstructed scans of real trees and developmental models.},

This mortality is a product of acute drought compounded by the long-established removal of a key ecosystem process: frequent, low- to moderate-intensity fire. The recent tree mortality has many implications for the future of these forests and the ecological goods and services they provide to society. Future wildfire hazard following this mortality can be generally characterized by decreased crown fire potential and increased surface fire intensity in the short to intermediate term. The scale of present tree mortality is so large that greater potential for ``mass fire'' exists in the coming decades, driven by the amount and continuity of dry, combustible, large woody material that could produce large, severe fires. For long-term adaptation to climate change, we highlight the importance of moving beyond triage of dead and dying trees to making ``green'' (live) forests more resilient.},

Both prescribed fire and its mechanical surrogates are generally successful in meeting short-term fuel-reduction objectives such that treated stands are more resilient to high-intensity wildfire. Most available evidence suggests that these objectives are typically accomplished with few unintended consequences, since most ecosystem components (vegetation, soils, wildlife, bark beetles, carbon sequestration) exhibit very subtle effects or no measurable effects at all. Although mechanical treatments do not serve as complete surrogates for fire, their application can help mitigate costs and liability in some areas. Desired treatment effects on fire hazards are transient, which indicates that after fuel-reduction management starts, managers need to be persistent with repeated treatment, especially in the faster-growing forests in the southern United States.},

This paper presents information from a replicated, stand level experiment from mixed conifer forests in the north-central Sierra Nevada that investigated how control, mechanical (crown thinning, thinning from below followed, rotary mastication), prescribed fire, and mechanical followed by prescribed fire treatments affected fuels, forest structure, potential fire behavior, and modeled tree mortality at 80th, 90th, and 97.5th percentile fire weather conditions. Fuels Management Analyst was used to model fire behavior and tree mortality. Thinning and mastication each reduced crown bulk density by approximately 19\% in mechanical only and mechanical plus fire treatments. Prescribed burning significantly reduced the total combined fuel load of litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1000h fuels by as much as 90\%. This reduction significantly altered modeled fire behavior in both mechanical plus fire and fire only treatments in terms of fireline intensity and predicted mortality. The prescribed fire only and mechanical followed by prescribed fire treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline intensities, rate of spread, and predicted mortality. The control treatment resulted in the most severe modeled fire behavior and tree mortality. Mechanical only treatments were an improvement over controls but still resulted in tree mortality at severe fire weather when compared with the treatments that included prescribed fire. Restoration of mixed conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect fire behavior and effects. Variation in existing stand structures will require solutions that are site specific but the principals outlined in this work should help managers make better decisions.},

Degradation of remnant materials from post-harvest fires severely limited available fire scars in this region. The earliest recorded fire was recorded in approximately 1615 and the last fire recorded was in 1884. The Ohlone and early immigrants were probably the primary source of ignitions in this region. For all sites combined, the mean fire return interval (FRI) was 12.0 years; the median FRI was 10 years. There was no significant difference in FRI's between plot aspects but there was a significant difference in MFI between the four sampled sites. The grand mean FRI for single trees (point) was 16.3 years. Past fire scars occurred most frequently in the latewood portion of the annual ring or during the dormant period. It is probable that the number of fires recorded in coast redwood trees is a subset of those fires that burned in adjacent grasslands and oak savannahs. Continued development of old-growth and young-growth coast redwood forests toward prehistoric conditions may be dependent of a fire regime where prescribed burning substitutes for the now-absent aboriginal ignitions.},

  abstract = {Forest structure and species composition in many western U.S. coniferous forests have been altered through fire exclusion, past and ongoing harvesting practices, and livestock grazing over the 20th century. The effects of these activities have been most pronounced in seasonally dry, low and mid-elevation coniferous forests that once experienced frequent, low to moderate intensity, fire regimes. In this paper, we report the effects of Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) forest stand treatments on fuel load profiles, potential fire behavior, and fire severity under three weather scenarios from six western U.S. FFS sites. This replicated, multisite experiment provides a framework for drawing broad generalizations about the effectiveness of prescribed fire and mechanical treatments on surface fuel loads, forest structure, and potential fire severity. Mechanical treatments without fire resulted in combined 1-, 10-, and 100-hour surface fuel loads that were significantly greater than controls at three of five FFS sites. Canopy cover was significantly lower than controls at three of five FFS sites with mechanical-only treatments and at all five FFS sites with the mechanical plus burning treatment; fire-only treatments reduced canopy cover at only one site. For the combined treatment of mechanical plus fire, all five FFS sites with this treatment had a substantially lower likelihood of passive crown fire as indicated by the very high torching indices. FFS sites that experienced significant increases in 1-, 10-, and 100-hour combined surface fuel loads utilized harvest systems that left all activity fuels within experimental units. When mechanical treatments were followed by prescribed burning or pile burning, they were the most effective treatment for reducing crown fire potential and predicted tree mortality because of low surface fuel loads and increased vertical and horizontal canopy separation. Results indicate that mechanical plus fire, fire-only, and mechanical-only treatments using whole-tree harvest systems were all effective at reducing potential fire severity under severe fire weather conditions. Retaining the largest trees within stands also increased fire resistance.},

These same actions have also been associated with the restoration of highly altered frequent-fire forests. Perhaps the vital element in the compatibility of these treatments is that both need to incorporate the salient characteristics that frequent fire produced\textemdash variability in vegetation structure and composition across landscapes and the inability to support large patches of high-severity fire. These characteristics can be achieved with both fire and mechanical treatments. The possible key to convergence of fuel reduction and forest restoration strategies is integrated planning that permits treatment design flexibility and a longer-term focus on fire reintroduction for maintenance. With changing climate conditions, long-term forest conservation will probably need to be focused on keeping tree density low enough (i.e., in the lower range of historic variation) for forest conditions to adapt to emerging disturbance patterns and novel ecological processes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the longevity of fuel treatments in terms of their ability to maintain fire behavior and effects within a desired range is an important question. The objective of this study was to determine how fuels, forest structure, and predicted fire behavior changed 7-years after initial treatments. Three different treatments: mechanical only, mechanical plus fire, and prescribed fire only, as well as untreated control, were each randomly applied to 3 of 12 experimental units. Many aspects of the initial fuel treatments changed in 7 years. The overall hazard of the control units increased significantly indicating continued passive management has further increased already high fire hazards. Mechanical only fire hazard decreased after 7 years and are now similar to the two fire treatments, which both maintained low hazards throughout the study. Tree density declined significantly 7 years after the initial fire only treatments, while basal area in both fire treatments was unchanged relative to immediate post-treatment conditions. Our findings indicating reduced fire hazard over time in mechanical only treatments might provide an opportunity for a staggered treatment schedule that included prescribed fire which could increase overall treatment longevity to approximately 20years. Changes in our mixed conifer forests after fuel treatment were generally larger than those reported from ponderosa pine forests in the Rocky Mountains.},

Here, we use a large set of remotely sensed wildfire observations, and explanatory data (focusing on weather), to demonstrate a Bayesian probabilistic ROS modelling approach. Our approach has two major advantages: (1) Using actual wildfire observations, instead of controlled fire observations, makes models developed well-suited to wildfire prediction; (2) Bayesian modelling accounts for the complex nature of wildfire spread by explicitly considering uncertainty in the data to produce probabilistic ROS predictions. We show that highly informative probabilistic predictions can be made from a simple Bayesian model containing wind speed, relative humidity and soil moisture. We provide current operational context to our work by calculating predictions from widely used deterministic ROS models in Australia.},

  abstract = {Ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative means to conventional forest inventory methods. By gauging the distances to multiple points on the surrounding object surfaces, LiDAR acquires 3D point clouds from which tree sizes and spatial distributions can be rapidly estimated. However, the high cost and specialized skills associated with LiDAR technologies have put them out of reach for many potential users. We here introduce ForestScanner, a free, mobile application that allows LiDAR-based forest inventories by means of iPhone or iPad with a built-in LiDAR sensor. ForestScanner does not require any manual analysis of 3D point clouds. As the user scans trees with an iPhone/iPad, ForestScanner estimates the stem diameters and spatial coordinates based on real-time instance segmentation and circle fitting. The users can visualize, check and share the scanning results in situ. By using ForestScanner, we measured the stem diameters and spatial coordinates of 672 trees within a 1 ha plot in 1 hr 39 min with an iPhone and in 1 hr 38 min with an iPad (diameter {$\geq$} 5 cm; detection rate = 100\%). The diameters measured by ForestScanner and a diameter tape were in good agreement; R2 = 0.963 for iPhone and R2 = 0.961 for iPad. ForestScanner and a conventional surveying system showed almost identical results for tree mapping (assessed by the spatial distances among trees within 0.04 ha subplots); Mantel R2 = 0.999 for both iPhone and iPad. ForestScanner reduced the person-hours required for measuring diameters to 25.7\%, mapping trees to 9.3\%, and doing both to 6.8\% of the person-hours taken using a dimeter tape and the conventional surveying system. Our results indicate that ForestScanner enables cost-, labour- and time-efficient forest inventories. The application can increase the accessibility to LiDAR for non-experts (e.g. students, citizen scientists) and enhance resource assessments and biodiversity monitoring in forests world-wide.},

To this end, we developed an R package called ForestFit that simplifies estimation of common probability distributions used to model tree diameter distributions, including the two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions, Johnson's SB distribution, Birnbaum\textendash Saunders distribution, and finite mixture distributions. Frequentist and Bayesian techniques are provided for individual tree diameter data, as well as grouped data. Additional functionality facilitates fitting curves to height-diameter data. The package also provides a set of functions for computing probability distributions and simulating random realizations from common finite mixture models.},

Experimental and modelling constraints (i.e. branch geometric definition, branch motion due to convection) showed differences in some of the recorded data (such as time to ignition, ignition temperature, mass loss and maximum temperature), but comparisons of variation in mass loss and temperature over time showed that modelling the fire propagation at the scale of a branch was possible if the branch fuel-moisture content remained lower than 25\%. For both experiments and modelling, the ranking of species according to their branch flammability highlighted identical groups of species.},

The unimodal models were found to be least effective for the irregularly shaped diameter distributions, particularly for low-density coniferous plots that have undergone shelterwood treatment. A significant improvement in results for these irregular plots was found with a finite mixture modelling approach, suggesting that finite mixture models may extend our ability to predict diameter distributions over large portions of the landscape.

  abstract = {Longevity of fuel treatment effectiveness to alter potential fire behavior is a critical question for managers preparing plans for fuel hazard reduction, prescribed burning, fire management, forest thinning, and other land management activities. Results from this study will help to reduce uncertainty associated with plan prioritization and maintenance activities. From 2001 to 2006, permanent plots were established in areas planned for hazardous fuel reduction treatments across 14 National Forests in California. Treatments included prescribed fire and mechanical methods (i.e., thinning of various sizes and intensities followed by a surface fuel treatment). After treatment, plots were re-measured at various intervals up to 10 years post-treatment. Very few empirically based studies exist with data beyond the first couple of years past treatment, and none span the breadth of California's coniferous forests. With the data gathered, this research aimed to meet three main objectives: Objective 1) Determine the length of time that fuel treatments are effective at maintaining goals of reduced fire behavior, by a) measuring effects of treatments on canopy characteristics and surface fuel loads over time, and b) modeling potential fire behavior with custom fuel models. Objective 2) Quantify the uncertainty associated with the use of standard and custom fuel models. Objective 3) Assess prescribed fire effects on carbon stocks and validate modeled outputs. Results have shown initial reductions in surface fuels from prescribed fire treatments recover to pretreatment levels by 10 yr post-treatment. Mechanical treatments continue to have variable effects on surface fuels. With the exception of mechanical treatments in red fir, both treatment types resulted in increased live understory vegetation by 8 yr post-treatment relative to pre-treatment. Mechanical treatment effects on stand structure remains fairly consistent through 8 yr post-treatment. Fire-induced delayed mortality contributes to slight decreases in canopy cover and canopy bulk density over time. For both treatment types, overall canopy base height decreases in later years due to in-growth of smaller trees, but it remains higher than pre-treatment. The changes in fuel loads and stand structure are reflected in fire behavior simulations via custom fuel modeling. Surface fire flame lengths were initially reduced as a result of prescribed fire, but by 10 yr post-treatment they exceeded the pre-treatment lengths. Though a low proportion of type of fire, initial reductions in potential crown fire returned to pre-treatment levels by 8 yr post-treatment; passive crown fire remained reduced relative to pre-treatment for the duration. Mechanical treatments showed variable and minimal effects on surface fire flame length over time; however the incidence of active crown fire was nearly halved from this treatment for the duration. The Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) was used to model potential fire behavior for plots treated with prescribed fire to determine the differences in modeled fire behavior using standard and custom fuel models. In general predicted fire behavior from custom versus standard fuel models were similar with mean surface fire flame lengths slightly higher using standard fuel models for all time steps until the 8 yr post treatment. Similarly, custom fuel models predicted a higher instance of surface fire than standard fuel models with the exception of 8 yr post-treatment. To better understand the impact of prescribed fire on carbon stocks, we estimated aboveground and belowground (roots) carbon stocks using field measurements in FFE-FVS, and simulated wildfire emissions, before treatment and up to 8 yr post-prescribed fire. Prescribed fire treatments reduced tota 3 | JFS Final Report 09-1-01 -1 carbon by 13\%, with the largest reduction in the forest floor (litter and duff) pool and the smallest the live tree pool. Combined carbon recovery and reduced wildfire emissions allowed the initial carbon source from wildfire and treatment to become a sink by 8 yr post-treatment relative to pre-treatment if both were to burn in a wildfire. In a comparison of field-derived versus FFE-FVS simulated carbon stocks, we found the total, tree, and belowground live carbon pools to be highly correlated. However, the variability within the other carbon pools compared was high (up to 212\%).},

The partially harvested and burned values for 1- and 100-h classes were also significantly lower than in the other stand conditions.

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is a widely used forest management tool, yet the long-term effectiveness of prescribed fire in reducing fuels and fire hazards in many vegetation types is not well documented. We assessed the magnitude and duration of reductions in surface fuels and modeled fire hazards in coniferous forests across nine U.S. national parks in California and the Colorado Plateau. We used observations from a prescribed fire effects monitoring program that feature standard forest and surface fuels inventories conducted pre-fire, immediately following an initial (first-entry) prescribed fire and at varying intervals up to {$>$}20years post-fire. A subset of these plots was subjected to prescribed fire again (second-entry) with continued monitoring. Prescribed fire effects were highly variable among plots, but we found on average first-entry fires resulted in a significant post-fire reduction in surface fuels, with litter and duff fuels not returning to pre-fire levels over the length of our observations. Fine and coarse woody fuels often took a decade or longer to return to pre-fire levels. For second-entry fires we found continued fuels reductions, without strong evidence of fuel loads returning to levels observed immediately prior to second-entry fire. Following both first- and second-entry fire there were increases in estimated canopy base heights, along with reductions in estimated canopy bulk density and modeled flame lengths. We did not find evidence of return to pre-fire conditions during our observation intervals for these measures of fire hazard. Our results show that prescribed fire can be a valuable tool to reduce fire hazards and, depending on forest conditions and the measurement used, reductions in fire hazard can last for decades. Second-entry prescribed fire appeared to reinforce the reduction in fuels and fire hazard from first-entry fires.},

  abstract = {Forests {$>$}80m tall have the highest biomass, and individual trees in these forests are Earth's largest with deep crowns emerging above neighboring vegetation, but it is unclear to what degree these maxima depend on the emergent trees themselves or a broader-scale forest structure. Here we advance the concept of emergent facilitation, whereby emergent trees benefit co-occurring species. Trees reorganize foliage within crowns to optimize available light and, if long-lived, can reiterate after crown damage to become emergent. The height, depth, and spacing of emergent trees in turn allows for abundant light to pass through the canopy, leading to light-use complementarity as well as elevated biomass, leaf area, and species diversity of the forest as a whole. We chose Sequoia sempervirens to develop this concept and installed eleven 1-ha plots in old-growth forests spanning nearly six degrees of latitude in California. Each plot was based off a 316-m-long centerline where biomass and leaf area of all vegetation were quantified. We employed hierarchical measurements and stratified random sampling spanning the full size range of individuals to generate 180 equations for determining biomass and leaf area of all dominant plant species in these forests. Biomass (5190Mgha-1), leaf area (LAI=19.4), and aboveground carbon (2600Mgha-1) are global maxima, occurring in plots with the highest proportion of emergent trees. Decay-resistant Sequoia heartwood contributes the bulk of this mass, ranging from 61.5 to 76.7\% of plot totals. Heartwood is a key contributor to the development of trees with emergent crowns, since its durability enables trees to recover leaf area and to re-grow crowns after damage so that they can continue expanding for millennia. By distributing leaf area among fewer trees with deeper crowns, Sequoia maintains very high leaf area itself (LAI up to 14.5) while simultaneously allowing other species to flourish underneath (non-Sequoia LAI up to 8.0). Because Sequoia is not replaced by other species, aboveground biomass, leaf area, and carbon content of these forests are essentially asymptotic over time.},

Although there were significant differences in the number and density of strikes among bioregions, the annual, monthly, and hourly patterns were similar. The number of strikes increased with elevation. Strike polarity varied by month, and mean peak positive current, mean peak negative current, and number of return strokes per strike varied by bioregion. Weather patterns associated with lightning included strengthened high pressure cells stationed over the western United States that deploy moist monsoonlike air masses and promote rising motions, especially over mountain features. Understanding the variation in lightning strike distributions provides insight into the role of fire in different bioregions of the state and aids in the prediction of wildland fire occurrence.},

(2) The behaviour of fourteen experimental fires in fynbos tall open shrublands is described. Rates of spread ranged from 0.04 to 0.89 m s-1, flame lengths from 2.8 to 7.0 m and fire intensities from 515 to 20 709 kW m-1. (3) The fire behaviour is compared to predictions from Rothermel's fire spread model, which uses fuel characteristics and environmental conditions to predict fire spread and intensity. Predictions of rate of spread and flame length were good but fire intensity was underestimated where biomass and fire hazard were high. (4) The results are compared to fire behaviour in other shrubland ecosystems. Rates of fire spread and fire intensity are greater in fynbos than in Scottish heathland, and are equivalent to those reported for Californian chaparral. (5) The inclusion of fire danger indices and predictions based on Rothermel's model in fynbos fire records will enhance their value. The model can also be useful in fire research, particularly in homogenous vegetation, and represents an improvement on techniques such as the measurement of fire temperature.},

Coast redwood also has a long list of traits that allow it to persist and dominate under such a chronic fire regime: thick bark, flammable litter, ability to resprout, and rapid pruning. Determining how redwood fire regimes functioned is a major question for restoration and conservation efforts. The origins of frequent fires in redwood fire history studies is often assigned to Native American land uses, with little attention to lightning or the region's fire-prone adjacent ecosystems. Results from the few fires studied in the region suggest that we have much to learn from science and management perspectives about how fire behaves, its effects, and the elements of its enigmatic fire regime.},

We studied the effects of the emergent disease sudden oak death (SOD) and the resulting functional extinction of tanoak, a highly susceptible native tree with flammable litter, on future community flammability. We quantified four flammability metrics (flame height; flaming duration; smoldering duration; and fuel consumed) for litter from each of five species that co-occur with tanoak and for species mixtures with and without tanoak (n~=~14). We combined these flammability metrics in a Principal Components Analysis to evaluate potential shifts in litter flammability from pre-SOD (with tanoak litter) to post-SOD (where tanoak was replaced equally with remaining species). Litter flammability changed following the loss of tanoak, but the differences were species- and community-specific. Mixed-evergreen fuels where coast Douglas-fir litter replaced tanoak experienced consistent declines in flammability. Few substantive changes occurred in communities where coast redwood or other hardwoods co-occurred. We found consistent synergistic flammability effects when multiple species' litters were mixed; in cases where two or more species were mixed, most (75\%) combinations burned with higher intensity (+8.1\%) and fuelbeds flamed for a longer duration (+17.1\%). Our work demonstrates that potential surface fire behavior in northwestern California may be dampened where Douglas-fir replaces tanoak, while those communities with other hardwoods or coast redwood may have redundant fuels and tanoak's absence in future fires may be inconspicuous. These results underscore the potential for cascading effects of non-native pathogens on ecosystem function in fire-prone ecosystems.},

Globally, crown scorch from fires in savannas, woodlands and forests causes tree stress and death across diverse taxa. The term crown scorch, however, is inconsistently and ambiguously defined in the literature, causing confusion and conflicting interpretation of results. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms causing foliage death from fire are poorly understood. The consequences of crown scorch \textendash{} alterations in physiological, biogeochemical and ecological processes and ecosystem recovery pathways \textendash{} remain largely unexamined. Most research on the topic assumes the mechanism of leaf and bud death is exposure to lethal air temperatures, with few direct measurements of lethal heating thresholds. Notable information gaps include how energy transfer injures and kills leaves and buds, how nutrients, carbohydrates, and hormones respond, and what physiological consequences lead to mortality. We clarify definitions to encourage use of unified terminology for foliage and bud necrosis resulting from fire. We review the current understanding of the physical mechanisms driving foliar injury, discuss the physiological responses, and explore novel ecological consequences of crown injury from fire. From these elements, we propose research needs for the increasingly interdisciplinary study of fire effects.},

  abstract = {The National Wildfire Coordinating Group definition of extreme fire behavior (EFB) indicates a level of fire behavior characteristics that ordinarily precludes methods of direct control action. One or more of the following is usually involved: high rate of spread, prolific crowning/spotting, presence of fire whirls, and strong convection column. Predictability is difficult because such fires often exercise some degree of influence on their environment and behave erratically, sometimes dangerously. Alternate terms include ``blow up'' and ``fire storm.'' Fire managers examining fires over the last 100 years have come to understand many of the factors necessary for EFB development. This work produced guidelines included in current firefighter training, which presents the current methods of predicting EFB by using the crown fire model, which is based on the environmental influences of weather, fuels, and topography. Current training does not include the full extent of scientific understanding. Material in current training programs is also not the most recent scientific knowledge. National Fire Plan funds have sponsored newer research related to wind profiles' influence on fire behavior, plume growth, crown fires, fire dynamics in live fuels, and conditions associated with vortex development. Of significant concern is that characteristic features of EFB depend on conditions undetectable on the ground, relying fundamentally on invisible properties such as wind shear or atmospheric stability. Obviously no one completely understands all the factors contributing to EFB because of gaps in our knowledge. These gaps, as well as the limitations as to when various models or indices apply should be noted to avoid application where they are not appropriate or warranted. This synthesis will serve as a summary of existing extreme fire behavior knowledge for use by fire managers, firefighters, and fire researchers. The objective of this project is to synthesize existing EFB knowledge in a way that connects the weather, fuel, and topographic factors that contribute to development of EFB. This synthesis will focus on the state of the science, but will also consider how that science is currently presented to the fire management community, including incident commanders, fire behavior analysts, incident meteorologists, National Weather Service office forecasters, and firefighters. It will seek to clearly delineate the known, the unknown, and areas of research with the greatest potential impact on firefighter protection.},

  abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19thand 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

  abstract = {Understanding the influences of forest management practices on wildfire severity is critical in fire-prone ecosystems of the western United States. Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and sequential autoregression (SAR) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildfires: the Camp 32 fire in western Montana, the School fire in southeastern Washington, and the Warm fire in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the LANDFIRE project were used to control for prefire variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three fires, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the SAR models than in the OLS models. Spatial error terms in the SAR models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the LANDFIRE data, including spatiotemporal variability in fire weather and landscape-level effects of reduced fire severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

  abstract = {Projected increases in fire occurrence and severity in the western United States have created heightened interest in postfire ecological research in Pacific Northwest forest communities. A 2017 mixed-severity fire event at the northern range margin of Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) provided a rare opportunity to analyze early postfire data on the interacting effects of burn severity, stem size, and species biology on survivorship and recovery of coast redwood and three forest community associates (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii, ``Douglas-fir''; Notholithocarpus densiflorus, ``tanoak''; and Rhododendron macrophyllum, ``coast rhododendron''). We employed recursive partitioning to build decision trees that accurately classified (80\textendash 88\% prediction accuracy) the postfire response of the four primary woody species present in this community. Species specific postfire responses were variable across stem diameters and burn severities, but the ability of three of the four primary woody species to resprout resulted in a resilient postfire community that quickly initiated recovery. Large coast redwood parent stems most typically survived and resprouted from their bole and base, regardless of fire severity, and even the smallest redwood individuals resprouted from their base. Basal sprouting characteristics of coast redwood including sprout presence, growth, and abundance were found to be positively correlated with increasing burn severity. Douglas-fir showed considerable fire resistance at low to moderate burn severities, but high severity fire killed trees of all sizes. Tanoak and coast rhododendron parent stems typically died and resprouted from the base except where burn severity was very low. We conclude by using our findings to discuss the utility and role of fire in forest management, and consider future research avenues that could help to solidify our understanding of the impact and role of fire in these and similar communities.},

The study included implementation of relatively hot prescribed burns in mixed-conifer forests that have been managed with gap-based silviculture. The fires burned through 12-, 22-, 32-, and 100-year-old cohorts, thus enabling an analysis of stand age influences on fire effects. Mastication and precommercial thinning were assessed as prefire treatments in the 12-year-old stands. Postburn mortality and crown scorch declined with stand age. There was a clear tradeoff between fuel consumption and high rates of tree damage and mortality in the 12-year-old stands. Masticated stands had higher levels of mean crown scorch (78\%) compared with precommercially thinned stands (52\%). Mortality for all 12-year-old stands was high, as nearly half of the trees were dead 1 year after the fires. Giant sequoia and ponderosa pine had relatively high resistance to fire-related mortality. When applying the concept of pyrosilviculture, there may be opportunities to combine prescribed fire with regeneration harvests that create a variety of gap sizes to sustain both low fire hazard and promote structural heterogeneity and sustainable age structures that may not be achieved with prescribed fire alone.},

  abstract = {Rising temperatures and more frequent and severe droughts are driving increases in tree mortality in forests around the globe. However, in many cases, the likely trajectories of forest recovery following drought-related mortality are poorly understood. In many fire-suppressed western U.S. forests, management is applied to reverse densification and restore natural forest structure and species composition, but it is unclear how such management affects post-mortality recovery. We addressed these uncertainties by examining forest stands that experienced mortality during the severe drought of 2012\textendash 2016 in California, USA. We surveyed post-drought vegetation along a gradient of overstory mortality severity in paired treated (mechanically thinned or prescribed-burned) and untreated areas in the Sierra Nevada. Treatment substantially reduced tree density, particularly in smaller tree size classes, and these effects persisted through severe drought-related overstory mortality. However, even in treated areas with severe mortality ({$>$}67\% basal area mortality), the combined density of residual (surviving) trees (mean 44 trees/ha) and saplings (mean 189 saplings/ha) frequently (86\% of plots) fell within or exceeded the natural range of variation (NRV) of tree density, suggesting little need for reforestation intervention to increase density. Residual tree densities in untreated high-mortality plots were significantly higher (mean 192 trees/ha and 506 saplings/ha), and 96\% of these plots met or exceeded the NRV. Treatment disproportionately removed shade-tolerant conifer species, while mortality in the drought event was concentrated in pines (Pinus ponderosa and P. lambertiana); as a consequence, the residual trees, saplings, and seedlings in treated areas, particularly those that had experienced moderate or high drought-related mortality, were more heavily dominated by broadleaf (``hardwood'') trees (particularly Quercus kelloggii and Q. chrysolepis). In contrast, residual trees and regeneration in untreated stands were heavily dominated by shade-tolerant conifer species (Abies concolor and Calocedrus decurrens), suggesting a need for future treatment. Because increased dominance of hardwoods brings benefits for plant and animal diversity and stand resilience, the ecological advantages of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire treatments may, depending on the management perspective, extend even to stands that ultimately experience high drought-related mortality following treatment.},

Nearest-neighbor (NN) imputation maps were developed for 539,000ha in the central Oregon Cascades, USA. Mapped explanatory data included tasseled-cap indices and disturbance history metrics (year, magnitude, and duration of disturbance) from LTS imagery, lidar-derived vegetation metrics, climate, topography, and soil parent material. Vegetation data from USDA Forest Service forest inventory plots was summarized at two plot sizes (plot and subplot) and geographically located with two levels of accuracy (standard and improved). Maps of vegetation composition and structure were developed with the Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) method of NN imputation using different combinations of explanatory variables, plot spatial resolution, and plot positional accuracy. Lidar vegetation indices greatly improved predictions of live tree structure, moderately improved predictions of snag density and down wood volume, but did not consistently improve species predictions. LTS disturbance metrics improved predictions of forest structure, but not to the degree of lidar indices, while also improving predictions of many species. Absence of disturbance attribution (i.e. disturbance type such as fire or timber harvest) in LTS disturbance metrics may have limited our ability to predict forest structure. Absence of corrected lidar intensity values may also have lowered accuracy of snag and species predictions. However, LTS disturbance attribution and lidar corrected intensity values may not be able to overcome fundamental limitations of remote sensing for predicting snags and down wood that are obscured by the forest canopy. Improved GPS plot locations had little influence on map accuracy, and we suggest under what conditions improved GPS plot locations may or may not improve the accuracy of predictive maps that link remote sensing with forest inventory plots. Subplot NN imputation maps had much lower accuracy compared to maps generated using response variables from larger whole plots. No single map had optimal results for every mapped variable, suggesting map users and developers need to prioritize what forest vegetation attributes are most important for any given map application.},

  abstract = {An estimated 128~M trees died during the 2012\textendash 2016 California drought, largely in the southern Sierra Nevada Range. Prescribed burning and mechanical thinning are widely used to reduce fuels and restore ecosystem properties, but it is unclear if these treatments improve tree growth and vigor during extreme drought. This study examined tree growth responses after thinning, prescribed burning, and extreme drought at the Teakettle Experimental Forest, a historically frequent fire mixed-conifer forest in the southern Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Mechanical thinning (no thin, understory thin, and overstory thin) and prescribed burning (unburned, fall burning) were implemented in 2000\textendash 2001. Using annual growth data from increment cores, over 10,000 mapped and measured trees, and lidar-derived metrics of solar radiation and topographic wetness, we had two primary questions. First, what were the growth responses to thinning and prescribed burning treatments, and did these responses persist during the 2012\textendash 2016 drought? Second, what tree-level attributes and environmental conditions influenced growth responses to treatments and drought? Thinning increased residual tree growth and that response persisted through extreme drought 10\textendash 15~years after treatments. Growth responses were higher in overstory versus understory thinning, with differences between thinning types more pronounced during drought. Species-specific growth responses were strongest with overstory thinning, with sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) having higher growth responses compared to white fir (Abies concolor) and Jeffery pine (Pinus jeffreyi). For individual trees, factors associated with higher growth responses were declining pretreatment growth trend, smaller tree size, and post-treatment low neighborhood basal area. Growth responses were initially not influenced by topography, but topographic wetness became important during extreme drought. Mechanical thinning resulted in durable increases in residual tree growth rates during extreme drought over a decade after thinning occurred, indicating treatment longevity in mitigating drought stress. In contrast, tree growth did not improve after prescribed burning, likely due to fire effects that reduced surface fuels, but had little effect on reducing tree density. Thinning treatments promoted durable growth responses, but focusing on stand-level metrics may ignore important tree-level attributes such as localized competition and topography associated with higher water availability. Mechanical thinning was effective at improving growth in trees that had been experiencing declining growth trends, but was less effective in improving growth responses in large old trees of higher ecological importance.},

  abstract = {Tree diameter distributions are essential for the calculation of stem volume and biomass, as well as simulation of growth and yield and to understand timber assortments. Accurate and reliable prediction of tree diameter distributions is critical for optimizing forest structure compositions, scheduling silvicultural operations and promoting sustainable management. In this study, we investigated the potential of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for predicting tree diameter distributions using a bimodal finite mixture model (FMM) and a multimodal k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model (compared to the unimodal Weibull model (UWM)) over a subtropical planted forest in southern China. To do so, we first evaluated the capability of various LiDAR predictions (i.e., the bimodality coefficient (BC) and Lorenz-based indicators) to stratify forest structural types into unimodal and multimodal stands. Once the best LiDAR prediction for the differentiation was determined, the parameters of UWM (in non-specific and species-specific models) and FMM (in structure-specific models) were estimated by LiDAR-derived metrics and the tree diameter distributions of stands were generated by the estimated LiDAR parameters. When KNN was applied for constructing diameter distributions, optimal KNN strategies, including number of neighbors k, response configurations and imputation methods (i.e., Most Similar Neighbor (MSN) and Random Forest (RF)) for different species were heuristically determined. Finally, the predictive performance of estimated LiDAR the parameters of UWM, FMM and KNN for predicting diameter distributions were assessed. The results showed that LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators performed best for differentiation. Parameters of UWM and FMM were predicted well and the species-specific models had higher accuracies than the non-specific models. Overall, RF imputation from KNN with an optimal response set (i.e., DBH) were was stable than MSN imputation when k = 5 neighbors. In addition, the inclusion of bimodal FMM for differentiated all plots generally produced a more accurate result (Mean eR = 40.85, Mean eP = 0.20) than multimodal KNN (Mean eR = 52.19, Mean eP = 0.26), whereas the UWM produced the lowest performance (Mean eR = 52.31, Mean eP = 0.26). This study demonstrated the benefits of multimodal models with LiDAR for estimating diameter distributions for supporting forest inventory and sustainable forest management in subtropical planted forests.},

However, the kNN method usually relies on a large number of field inventory plots to impute tree lists, whereas the Weibull function relies on strong correlations between stand attributes and diameter distribution across large regions. In this study, we developed a framework to estimate wall-to-wall tree lists over large areas based on a limited number of forest inventory plots. This framework integrates the ability of extrapolating diameter distribution from Weibull and kNN imputation of wall-to-wall forest stand attributes from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We estimated tree lists using this framework in Chinese boreal forests (Great Xing'an Mountains) and evaluated the accuracy of this framework. The results showed that the passing rate of the Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov (KS) test for Weibull diameter distribution by species was from 52\% to 88.16\%, which means that Weibull distribution could describe the diameter distribution by species well. The imputed stand attributes (diameter at breast height (DBH), height, and age) from the kNN method showed comparable accuracy with the previous studies for all species. There was no significant difference in the tree density between the estimated and observed tree-lists. Results suggest that this framework is well-suited to estimating the tree-lists in a large area. Our results were also ecologically realistic, capturing dominant ecological patterns and processes.},

  abstract = {The interaction between carbon and flows within the vasculature is at the centre of most growth and developmental processes. Understanding how these fluxes influence each other, and how they respond to heterogeneous environmental conditions, is important to answer diverse questions in agricultural and natural ecosystem sciences. However, due to the high complexity of the plant\textendash environment system, specific tools are needed to perform such quantitative analyses. Here, we present CPlantBox, a whole-plant modelling framework based on the root system model CRootBox. CPlantBox is capable of simulating the growth and development of a variety of plant architectures (root and shoot). In addition, the flexibility of CPlantBox enables its coupling with external modelling tools. Here, we connected the model to an existing mechanistic model of water and carbon flows in the plant, PiafMunch. The usefulness of the CPlantBox modelling framework is exemplified in five case studies. Firstly, we illustrate the range of plant structures that can be simulated using CPlantBox. In the second example, we simulated diurnal carbon and water flows, which corroborates published experimental data. In the third case study, we simulated impacts of heterogeneous environment on carbon and water flows. Finally, we showed that our modelling framework can be used to fit phloem pressure and flow speed to (published) experimental data. The CPlantBox modelling framework is open source, highly accessible and flexible. Its aim is to provide a quantitative framework for the understanding of plant\textendash environment interaction.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, restoration treatments are being implemented to dually meet wildland fire hazard reduction alongside ecological objectives. Restoration treatments however deviate from conventional fuels treatments by emphasizing the re-creation of forest structure present prior to EuroAmerican settlement, notably the retention of single and grouped trees interspersed between canopy openings. As these historical forests persisted over cycles of fire returns, it is assumed that restoring these historical complex tree spatial patterns will, in turn, restore historical ecological processes. This includes more benign fire behavior that results in only partial tree mortality, allowing persistent and partial retention of forest cover over cycles of fire return. The qualitative description of historical forest structure, lacks, however, a clear process-based explanation detailing the interactions of heterogeneous forest structures and fire. While fires were historically frequent, it is unclear what role fire played in the genesis and maintenance of tree spatial patterns. If models of tree spatial dynamics can be improved and the interactions between tree spatial patterns and fire can be elucidated, forest managers will have an improved understanding of the implications of restoration-based fuels hazard reduction treatments both during fire-free periods and during fire events.  The aims of this dissertation were to: 1) explore the causes of tree spatial patterns in dry fire-frequent forests; 2) investigate the consequences of tree spatial patterns on potential fire behavior and effects; 3) determine how alternate silvicultural strategies targeted at manipulation of tree spatial patterns can influence fire behavior and effects. In Chapter 2, I explored spatial patterns of tree regeneration over 44 years in absence of fire. In cooler periods, regeneration preferred clustering in openings, including openings following overstory mortality and away from overstory trees. Mortality risk of regeneration was heightened nearer overstory trees. In warmer periods, these trends reversed, likely because of a 'nurse effect' from the overstory. In anticipation of climate change, these results suggest silviculturists may benefit by capturing regeneration mortality in within openings while keeping regeneration near the overstory. In Chapter 3, I found that regenerating trees also form heterogeneous patterns following stand-replacing fires. In these sparse, early seral forests, all species were spatially aggregated, partly attributable to the influence of topography and beneficial interspecific attractions between ponderosa pine and other species. Results from this study suggest that scale-dependent, and often facilitatory, rather than competitive, processes act on regenerating trees. In Chapter 4, I studied the interaction between fire and tree spatial patterns, both historically and in modern forests. Tree mortality in the historical period was clustered and density-dependent because tree mortality was greater among small trees, which tended to be assembled in tightly spaced clusters. Tree mortality in the contemporary period was widespread, except for dispersed large trees, because most trees were a part of large, interconnected tree groups. Postfire tree patterns in the historical period, unlike the contemporary period, were within the historical range of variability found for the western United States. This divergence suggests that decades of forest dynamics without significant disturbances have altered the historical means of pyric pattern maintenance. In Chapter 5, I examined how fuels treatment designs with different manipulations of tree spatial patterns may influence treatment effectiveness. I simulated fires on hypothetical cuttings which manipulated the arrangement of crown fuels horizontally and vertically, either increasing the distance between tree crowns or not, and either removing small trees or not. All cutting methods reduced fire behavior and severity, but the results confirm possible tradeoffs between ecological restoration and hazard reduction; treatments that separated tree crowns reduced severity the most because these treatments reduced crown fire spread. But these can easily be overcome where restoration treatments incorporate small tree removal, because this action limits crown fire initiation. Managers could also incorporate managed fires to reduce surface fuel loads and use more aggressive cuttings to further gains in hazard reduction, regardless of cutting method used.},

  abstract = {Forest managers are increasingly using mechanical treatments in dry forests of the western US in order to produce stands with spatially complex structure while also reducing crown fire potential. However, there has been a lack of evaluation of these treatments on spatial patterns in dry forest types of the western US. In addition, the implications of heterogeneous fuels complexes on fire behavior are not well understood due to a lack of experimental data and the use of semi empirical models which cannot account for the structural complexity of fuel beds. The lack of well quantified studies on changes in spatial heterogeneity and limitations on quantifying the associated fire behavior suggest there are gaps in our knowledge regarding the implications of mechanical fuels treatments.   The primary emphasis of this thesis is in Chapter 1. I comprehensively stem-mapped seven 4 ha plots, after treatment in dry, coniferous treated stands across the Southern Rockies and Colorado Plateau. Then, I estimated pre-treatment structure by constructing linear allometric regressions of tree characteristics and applying these to mapped stumps thus producing stem-maps before treatment. To investigate how these treatments altered structural complexity, I used spatial statistical analyses to assess spatial relationships of trees, before and after treatment, occurring at stand and within-stand scales as well as horizontal and vertical dimensions. Then, I assessed the cumulative effects of the reduction and spatial alterations of structure on potential fire behavior, measured by rate of spread, fireline intensity and percent of canopy consumed, across a range of open wind speeds using the Wildland urban-interface Dynamics Simulator (WFDS). WFDS is a physics-based model capable of representing the 3-D complexities of the fuels complex and captures fuel-atmosphere-fire dynamics through space and time. Results from this chapter suggest (1) treatments impact facets of structural complexity in varying ways, though avoided large-scale homogenization of forest structure, (2) within canopy wind speeds increase following treatments and, (3) fire behavior can be altered in two distinct manners following treatments. In most cases, the alterations in the fuels complex coupled with greater within canopy wind speeds resulted in an overall decrease in potential fire behavior and crown fire activity, especially at high open wind velocities.  However, in two cases I examined there were increases in fire behavior following mechanical treatments. In these cases the increases were primarily associated with increased surface fire behavior.  The results from this chapter suggest that these mechanical treatments may not always enhance, but can promote, a degree of structural complexity, and that mechanical treatments are effective if implemented strategically.  Chapter 2 reports on litter bulk density values for use by managers to improve fuel loading assessments. Litter bulk density as a factor, in conjunction with litter depth, is used to estimate litter load necessary for fuel hazard assessments as litter is a primary carrier of fire and its load impacts potential rate of spread, fireline intensity and smoke production. In addition litter load estimation is needed for estimating carbon and wildlife habitat availability. However, available litter bulk density factors are limited by region, forest type, and site history. This chapter uses data collected on litter bulk density in both ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Lawson) dominated and dry mixed conifer stands throughout the southern Rockies across sites that have been recently mechanically treated and in recently undisturbed sites. Results show litter bulk density was much lower in ponderosa pine forest than mixed conifer, and the impact of treatment was relatively negligible. These results provide managers in the southern Rockies with a regionalized value that may improve accuracy for estimation of litter load.},

  abstract = {Quaking aspen is found in western forests of the United States and is currently at risk of loss due to conifer competition at within-stand scales. Wildfires in these forests are impactful owing to conifer infilling during prolonged fire suppression post-Euro-American settlement. Here, restoration cuttings seek to impact wildfire behavior and aspen growing conditions. In this study, we explored how actual and hypothetical cuttings with a range of conifer removal intensity altered surface fuel and overstory structure at stand and fine scales. We then simulated wildfires, examining fire behavior and effects on post-fire forest structures around aspen trees. We found that conifer removal constrained by lower upper diameter limits ({$<$}56 cm) had marginal effects on surface fuel and overstory structure, likely failing to enhance resource conditions sufficiently to sustain aspen. Increasing the diameter limit also led to a higher likelihood of fire spread and a higher rate of spread, owing to greater within-canopy wind speed, though crown fire activity decreased. Our simulations suggest heavier treatments could facilitate reintroduction of fire while also dampening the effects of wildfires on forest structure. Cutting specifications that relax diameter limits and remove a substantial portion of conifer overstory could better promote aspen restoration and mitigate fire hazard.},

  abstract = {Restoration treatments in dry forests of the western US often attempt silvicultural practices to restore the historical characteristics of forest structure and fire behavior. However, it is suggested that a reliance on non-spatial metrics of forest stand structure, along with the use of wildland fire behavior models that lack the ability to handle complex structures, may lead to uncharacteristically homogeneous rather than heterogeneous forest structures following restoration. In our study, we used spatially explicit forest inventory data and a physics based fire behavior model to investigate the effects of restoration driven, variable retention harvests on structural complexity, both of horizontal and vertical dimensions, and potential fire behavior. Structural complexity was assessed at stand and patch scales using a combination of point pattern analyses, a patch detection algorithm, and nearest-neighbor and tree patch indices of height variation. The potential fire behavior before and after treatment was simulated across a range of open wind speeds using a 3-D physics based fire behavior model, the Wildland-urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS). Our results show that treatments resulted in an aggregated spatial pattern of trees consisting of a matrix of individual trees, clumps and openings similar to descriptions of historical dry forests. Treatments had inconsistent effects on vertical complexity across sites likely due to differences in treatment of ladder fuels; lack of reference conditions hinder evaluation of this structural aspect. Simulation modeling using WFDS suggest that treatments moderated fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and canopy consumption across all wind speeds tested and shifted potential fire behavior towards historical ranges. Our findings suggest that current restoration-based variable retention harvests can simultaneously fulfill objectives of altering structural complexity and of reducing fire behavior, though we recommend further research on desired ranges of vertical complexity to inform treatment design.},

In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
