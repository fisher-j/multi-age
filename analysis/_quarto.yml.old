  title: >
    Regeneration and Fuel Loads with Varying Overstory Retention in Redwood
    Stands 10 Years after Transformation to Multiaged Management
  author: Judson Fisher
  date: 2024-02-13
  abstract: >
    This is an analysis of the 10-year remeasure of the Redwood multi-age
    experiment. It was started by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture
    at Cal-Poly Humboldt. The experiment is located in the Jackson Demonstration
    State Forest in Mendocino County, California. The multi-age experiment
    explores the regeneration response of several species following different
    harvesting techniques including group selection, aggregated retention, and
    high/low dispersed retention. The 10-year re-measure data includes surface
    fuel characterization.
