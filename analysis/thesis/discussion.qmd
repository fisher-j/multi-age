# Discussion

TODO:
- Forest management for timber and other objectives and prescribed and wild fire
  are inherently interlinked
- This requires research which considers these historically disjunct realms of
  research in a wholistic way
- Shifts in species composition / dominance can affect prescribed and wild fire
  behavior, and vice-versa
- Aspect is an important predictor that was not explicitly accounted for in our
  model, and may have led to inflated uncertainty 
- GS and LD treatments were generally much harder to navigate in the field.
- Cost of treatments
- 1-hr redwood fuels differed from other studies in that we implemented a cutoff
- Discuss the decision to allow surface fuels to extend to greater than 2 meters
- similar bulk densities for duff and litter: Stuart. Also, Finney combined the
  two.
- little is understood about tanoak sprout response under shade
  [@wilkinsonTanoakSproutDevelopment1997], this study contributes to that
  knowledge.

## Composition

### Minor species

Our sampling included relatively few minor species and differences across
treatments were small. The only statistically detectable difference occurred
between the LD and HA treatment where the latter had less basal area of minor
species. While this could be due to low numbers overall numbers of occurrences of
minor species and high variability within treatments, this phenomena is
corroborated by the low vegetation response found in the HA treatment for the
separately gathered fuels data (@fig-fuel-pre-pct), as well as for tanoak sprout
basal area where the only statistically supported evidence of treatment
difference was between the GS and HA treatments. Potential differences in minor
species abundance is likely only relevant for grand fir, due to its shade
tolerance [@webbWhiskeySpringsLongterm2012]. Red alder and wester hemlock were
observed earlier in this experiment, but were not detected with our current
experimental design [@mumaConvertingCoastRedwood2019].

Douglas-fir is a minor species of special interest due to it's commercial value
and ability to compete with redwoods in the first 100 years of stand development
[@wenselSiteIndexSystem1986]. We didn't detect statistically supported
differences between treatments in terms of basal area (@fig-regen-ba) or stem
counts (@fig-df-counts). While our observed recruitment density of Douglas-fir
seedlings may be sufficient for the eventual production of a viable cohort in a
multi-aged system [Schütz and Röhnisch, 2003, as cited in @schutzCanDouglasFir2013], only
the LD and GS treatments are likely to maintain overstory densities conducive to
Douglas-fir seedling development [@millerCanSelectionThinning2001;
@schutzCanDouglasFir2013] given the overstory basal areas recorded at the
initiation of the experiment [@mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022]. Rapidly developing
redwood and tanoak sprouts will likely further comprise Douglas-fir seedlings
competitive ability.

### Redwood and tanoak

We found redwood growth in terms of average total basal area of sprouts 10 years
after harvest treatment, responded strongly and positively to
increasing levels of openness and the tanoak response was comparatively modest.
This is expected based on traditional shade tolerance theory
[@hornAdaptiveGeometryTrees1971] and what is commonly understood of these two
species (CITATIONS). 

The only statistically justified difference for tanoak was between the GS and HA
treatments. That we found slightly higher tanoak basal area in the HD treatment
compared to the HA may be confounded by the fact that this treatment resulted in
a greater number of tanaok stems less than 2.54 cm dbh (383 in HA vs 496 in HD,
data not shown) and that this size class was assigned the perhaps inappropriate
midpoint diameter of 1.27 cm. Thus, the basal area of these bushier tanaok in
the HD treatment may be slightly artificially elevated. On the other hand, the
small difference between the HA and HD treatments was mirrored in the vegetation
fuel loading data which was collected separately, adding support to the idea
that the HA treatment did in some way minimize tanoak sprout growth. It could be
that the lower light conditions in the HA and HD treatments approach a crossover
point where greater overstory densities would result in more growth for the
shade tolerant tanoak compared to the less shade-tolerant redwood. It is
important to remember that the HA and HD "high-density" treatments only targeted
a residual overstory relative density of 20% (that is 20% of assumed total
carrying capacity of the site), and it was selected as an upper limit given the
objective to maintain conifer growth. It seems likely that at higher overstory
densities we might see tanoak growth, in terms of total basal area, exceed that
of redwood. As mentioned previously, our use of basal area as a response did not
distinguish between number of stems and size of stems. There have been numerous
metrics used to attempt to assess shade tolerance
[@forresterResponseTreeRegeneration2014], our use of basal area (which conflates
growth and survival of sprouts) is justified given the assumption that these are
expected to be correlated in forests that don't undergo a long harsh winter
[@linSaplingGrowthSurvivorship2002]. In general, for tanoak we expect to see a
reduction of about one half moving from open overstory conditions to 20%
relative density.

Average redwood sprout basal area 10 years after treatment was much more
dramatically affected by overstory density and each step increase in overstory
density (GS -> LD -> HA) saw average redwood sprout basal area reduced by around
half. Aggregated retention resulted in about 1/3 greater basal area than in the
dispersed retention but the p-values for all comparisons except between GS and
high density treatments were very high. In all treatments, the uncertainty in
the average redwood basal area is much greater than that of tanoak, given that
we modeled the total basal area of all species in each vegetation plot, this
suggests that variability in redwood basal area was much greater than that of
tanoak across macro plots and/or sites. The greater relative uncertainty we
observed in redwood compared to tanoak may have to do with redwoods greater
sensitivity to light conditions. We selected sites with both north and south
facing slopes and this may have led to relatively larger differences for
redwoods growth response compared to tanoak. It could also be that this
uncertainty is due to variable light levels within macro plots. Given the
importance of aspect for growth response, reducing our uncertainty around
redwood basal area may require better incorporating the effect of aspect into
our model. An important consideration for redwood in these plots, is that after
thinning, a fraction of existing sprouts will be retained and these will
generally be the largest and most vigorous. An interesting question that is
overlooked by our focus on total basal area is if any treatment produced larger
individuals that would eventually be selected for retention. 

TODO: What about the potential effects of soil type
What about the potential effects of below-ground competition
what would tanoak abundance be if they were not competing with redwood?

## Sprout height

## Fuel loading

### Pre-PCT 

Fuel loading found in our treatments were comparable to those found in other
studies in redwood systems. Our treatment level averages for duff and litter
ranged from 40 to 55 Mg ha^-1^ in plots that had post-harvest basal areas (in
2012) of 0 to 40 m^2^ ha^-1^. This was comparable to total duff and litter
loading found in 120-year-old redwood stands (range: 29 to 55 Mg ha^-1^) as well
as old-growth stands (average: 50 Mg ha^-1^) and our raw average duff and litter
depth of 6.2 cm (data not shown) was similar to that found in a <30-year-old
mixed Douglas-fir/redwood stand
[@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985;@glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015].
We opted to combine duff and litter into a single metric following previous
studies that found similar bulk densities for duff and litter and that
separating the two resulted in little difference from and average bulk density,
given the wide variability found in duff and litter
depths[@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985, @finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993].

Our average total fine woody fuel loading, including one-, ten-, and one
hundred-hour-fuels (15 Mg ha^-1^) was within the range found in 120-year-old
stands (9 to 20 Mg ha^-1^, @finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993), double that
found in very young, mixed stands [@glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015], and 4 Mg ha^-1^ higher
than that found in old growth stands [@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985].

In the following I'll compare the average fuel loadings found in this study to
those found in the "old growth" and "very young, mixed" stands referenced above.

Our one-hr fuel loading which, which averaged about 1 Mg ha^-1^ was similar to
that found in the old-growth stand, but about half that found in the very young,
mixed stand. 

Our average 10-hr fuel loading was higher than in the very
young, mixed stand (3.4 vs. 2 Mg ha^-1^) but similar to the old growth stand.

Our average 100-hr fuel loading of about 11 Mg ha^-1^ was higher than in both
the old growth stands (5 Mg ha^-1^) and the very young, mixed stands (3 Mg ha^-1^).

Our average 1,000-hr fuel loading of 42 Mg ha^-1^ was somewhat lower than found
in old growth stands (63 Mg ha^-1^) as well as in the very young, mixed stands
(54 Mg ha^-1^). These estimates are accompanied by relatively high standard
errors, but it would not be surprising that State Park forest, with little to no
harvest activity would have a larger amount of large downed logs then an
actively managed forest such as ours.

Our elevated average 100-hr fuel loading may be the result of 
residual fuels left over from the harvest treatment that initiated our experiment
which would have been absent from the other sites referenced here. In the very
young, mixed stand, 100-hr fuels jumped to 10 Mg ha^-1^ immediately following a
thinning treatment. For our 10-hr fuels, it might be reasonable to suspect that
the smaller trees in the very young, mixed stand did not supply as much 10-hr
fuels because of the sizes of their branches, whereas branch shedding patterns
in the 10-hr time lags class were more similar between our stands and the old
growth ones. Our reduced 1-hr fuel loading compared to the very young, mixed
forest could be due to differing stand structures and species compositions. That
forest was composed of a large proportion very young Douglas-fir and would be
expected to have different forest floor characteristics and this notion is
supported by our finding of similar 1-hr fuel loading as in the old growth
study. Another source of possible error is differences in sampling method for
1-hr fuels. We established a cutoff where redwood particles smaller than roughly
2 mm were considered as litter, rather than 1-hr fuels. If we had counted every
redwood leaf-spray, regardless of size, we would have likely found higher 1-hr
fuel loads.

That we found similar average fuel loading in our Pre-PCT stands compared to two
studies in very different redwood forest structures is congruent with our
findings of few statistically significant differences between treatments in
terms of fuel loading. This result is common among other studies and is expected
due to the highly variable nature of forest fuels (CITATIONS). Statistical
difference at the p < 0.05 level were only found among treatments for 1-hr and
Vegetation loading, and nearly found for Duff & Litter. In all cases these
differences involved the HA treatment, but the nature of the comparisons varied
with fuel types. For instance, for Duff & Litter was lowest in the HA treatment
and highest in the HD treatment (p = 0.07). Although this difference was not
statistically supported, it was paralleled by a similar trend in vegetation fuel
loading as well as in tanoak basal area (@fig-regen-ba). In a study across
Sierra forests, fine fuel loading (including 1-, 10-, and 100-hr fuels) were
found to be correlated with overstory canopy cover and proportion of shade
tolerant species and associated these conditions, which represent recent shifts
in forest composition resulting from fire suppression, with an elevated risk
of high severity fire [@collinsVariabilityVegetationSurface2016]. The
differences we observed in duff & litter, and 1-hr fuel loads could be a result
of canopy cover and understory species composition directly, but it is likely
also a result of the microclimatic differences resulting from these different
stand structures. Fine fuel loads are a function of both recruitment and
decomposition and the latter is a function of moisture and temperature
(CITATIONS). Forest floor conditions in the HA treatment may have been somewhat
more moist than the more open treatments (due to sheltering), but warmer than
the HD treatment (due to greater light infiltration). While the differences in
duff & litter loading we observed are not likely to have a significant impact on
fire behavior, small differences in forest floor moisture can have significant
implications for prescribed burning operations because these are often conducted
under marginal conditions (CITATIONS). 

For both 1-hr fuel loading and Vegetation fuel loading, the HA treatment was most
similar to the HD treatment. In these cases it is not surprising that a greater
density of overstory trees would result in more twigs and less light available
for growth of vegetation at the surface. 

Vegetation fuel loading was lowest in the HA treatment, and the only statistical
difference was between the GS and HA treatments. This lower vegetation fuel
loading in the HA treatment is reflected in the tanoak basal area results for
the HA treatment, which were collected separately, and it is likely that tanoak
is largely responsible for the vegetative fuel loading differences. Although
vegetation fuel loading was not recorded by species, redwood and tanoak sprouts
comprised the vast majority of vegetation fuels. Consistently low foliar
moisture content levels have been recorded for tanaok
[@kuljianEffectsSuddenOak2010] and the foliage, like that of other
sclerophyllous species, is considered to be highly flammable
[@mcdonaldAdaptationsWoodyShrubs1981]. 

- our understanding of the precise conditions under which transition to crown
  fire occur are not well understood.
  - probably less so for evergreen, coastal hardwoods.
  - there is little information regarding live fuel flammability and crown
    ignition, although some sources suggest it is likely with low canopy base
    heights.
  - because of the relatively low bulk density of canopy fuels, smaller
    differences in fuel load equate to larger differences in total fuel volume
    and resulting fire behavior, as well as implications for aerial fuel
    continuity
  - sclerophyllous fuels found in chaparral ecosystems are are characterized by
    intense, stand replacing fires
  - these factors warrant more study into the fire behavior of this unique fuel
    type, including its requirements for combustion, fuel moisture, and more
    precise characterization of it's mass and bulk density.

TODO: I'm here: I'm comparing anomalous HA fuel conditions to composition results

It was also somewhat surprising that the modeled Vegetation fuel loading
differences were not more pronounced because, while conducting field work, the
GS and LD treatments were usually much more difficult to work in due to the
amount of understory growth present in these treatments. And these conditions
were also indicated by our findings of somewhat elevated basal area of tanoak
and redwood in those treatments. 

Our method of calculating vegetation fuel loading (estimated percent cover times
estimated height within an estimated cylinder) might have been overly imprecise.
Additionally, given the importance of understory light to the processes of
surface fuel decomposition as well as for understory growth, inclusion of the
variable: aspect might have led to better explanatory power in our models. Our
plots were established over a range of aspects, but it is plausible that
differences in aspect outweighed differences between treatments. We had hoped
that the inclusion of site and treatment as nested random effects would have
captured site and block level differences in aspect. Additionally, aspect is
largely a proxy for insolation, and this may have also varied with shade
conditions (very large trees or road cuts) outside of the plot.

### Post-PCT

Duff and litter are not reported for post-pct stands for two reasons. First,
these are not expected to have changed significantly given the relatively short
timespan before and after PCT. Second, our sampling protocol did not make it
clear how to quantify the loading for leaves attached to recently cut branches,
especially given that these "suspended litter" particles were in a state of
active transition to the ground, as they dry, abscise, and sift through the
coarser woody fuels as they make their way to the ground. This class may deserve
more attention because of it's potentially dynamic relationship with the timing
of prescribed fires: as suspended particles settle and begin to decompose they're
bulk density changes and bulk density is an important determinant of fire
behavior.

Crews were guided to thin to achieve the same understory conditions across all
four treatments and this is indicated by similar post-PCT vegetation fuel loads
(@fig-fuel-post-pct). Fuel differences resulting from PCT were driven by fuels
in the vegetation fuels class, i.e., growth and productivity. Vegetative growth
following thinning and harvest is an important consideration for fire informed
management. In our experiment, 10 years of growth (followed by PCT) led to some
increase in average 100-hr fuel loading but only for the GS treatment. Ten-hr
fuels increased in the GS and LD treatments apparently as a function reducing
competition in these treatments (@fig-fuel-pct-comparison). One-hr fuels
increased most, in the GS and LD treatments, but also started out somewhat lower
1-hr fuel loading than the HA and HD treatments, which resulted in the
post-pct fuel loading being similar, except for in the HA treatment, where
unexpectedly low vegetative fuel loading resulted in little to no increase in
1-hr fuels after PCT, likely because much of the existing vegetation (saplings)
needed to be retained to meet the prescription (@fig-fuel-pct-comparison).
Pre-commercial thinning resulted in little change in 1,000-hr fuels, as thinned
sapling stems were mostly under three inches, although a potential increase
observed in the HD treatment may have been a result of some previously retained
canopy trees being cut (12 inches dbh was the prescribed upper limit for
thinning). The model selection process resulted in slightly different models
after pre-commercial thinning, compared to before thinning for a given fuel
class. These changes may be somewhat arbitrary, as the model selection process
was guided by balancing parsimony, AIC, and the production of well distributed
residuals. In a few cases, the higher values associated with post-PCT fuel
loading predictions tended towards models that accounted for greater (variation
in) variability. 

The simple method we used probably over-estimated vegetation fuel loading,
evidenced by the fact that the large fuel loading differences observed in the
vegetation class are not reflected in the increase in fine fuels. Although the
contribution of slash foliage is not accounted for, it appears our method may
have over predicted vegetation loading by around a factor of three if we assume
that the majority of the difference in vegetation fuels should be captured by
the sum of the changes in fine fuels and the decrease in 100-hr fuels after PCT
is assumed to be the result of sampling error.

It can be seen from this analysis resulting surfaces fuel conditions are
expected to be the result of a complex interaction of productivity and
decomposition rate. Whether any of the differences we observed result in a
significant difference in prescribed or wild fire will need to be tested by
those disturbances. It is possible that the elevated 10-hr loads in the GS and
to a lesser degree, the LD treatments may represent greater fuel continuity
which could support prescribed fire operations. Likewise, the HA treatment's
lower fuel loading across classes could signify patchy fuel distribution.
Surface fuel moisture and wind speed are two variables which we did not study
but which have a strong influence on fire behavior and are also affected by
overstory density and arrangement. Given the relatively modest difference we
observed in fuel loads, it seems likely that those unmeasured factors would have
a greater bearing on fire outcomes.
