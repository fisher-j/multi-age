# Discussion

- Forest management for timber and other objectives and prescribed and wild fire
  are inherently interlinked
- This requires research which considers these historically disjunct realms of
  research in a wholistic way
- Shifts in species composition / dominance can affect prescribed and wild fire
  behavior, and vice-versa

## Composition

- Our sampling included relatively few minor species and differences across
  treatments were minor
  - The only statistically detectable difference was the HA treatment resulted
    in less minor species
    - I don't have an explanation for this, but seems likely an artifact of very
      few observations and perhaps the fact that basal area is a transformation
      of counts
  - Relevance for biodiversity?

- Douglas-fir: there was no appreciable differences detected among treatments
  either for basal area or number of stems
  - this suggests that our treatments were not growing-space limiting in terms of df
    regeneration: compare to other studies of DF regeneration
    - are we above or below the threshold for optimal df growing space?
  - Continued canopy closure could result in light limiting conditions in the
    future

- Like other studies in redwoods the least residual overstory density resulted
  in the greatest abundance of redwood.
  - RW basal area in LD (the next highest average redwood basal area) was half
    that of the GS treatment, but large ammount of variability meant that this
    difference was not statistically distinguishable from 0 at the 95%
    confidence level.
- Variability dereased with decreasing abundance
- HA and HD treatments were very similar
- This is all suggestive of quickly declining growth rates associated with
  increasing overstory density

- Treatment differences for tanoak were relatively similar, but with less
  difference between GS and LD treatments
- Small (non statistical) difference between HA and HD likely due to un
  realistic midpoit chosen for stems less than 1 cm.
  - reflects the fact that there were more (small) tanoak stems associated with
    increasing overstory density
    - perhaps due to slower rate of self-thinning resulting from slower growth
- what would tanoak abundance be if they were not competing with redwood?

## Sprout height

## Fuel loading

Fuel loading found in our treatments were comparable to those found in other
studies.
