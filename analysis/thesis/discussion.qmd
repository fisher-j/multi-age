# Discussion

- Forest management for timber and other objectives and prescribed and wild fire
  are inherently interlinked
- This requires research which considers these historically disjunct realms of
  research in a wholistic way
- Shifts in species composition / dominance can affect prescribed and wild fire
  behavior, and vice-versa
- Aspect was likely a confounding factor that we did not control for
- Confounding factors likely contributed to larger 95% confidence intervals
- GS and LD treatments were generally much harder to navigate in the field.
- Cost of treatments
- 1-hr redwood fuels differed from other studies in that we implemented a cutoff
- Discuss the decision to allow surface fuels to extend to greater than 2 meters
- similar bulk densities for duff and litter: stuart. Also, finney combined the
  two.

## Composition

Our sampling included relatively few minor species and differences across
treatments were small. The only statistically detectable difference was with the
HA treatment which resulted in less minor species. While this could be due to
low numbers and high variability within treatments, this phenomena is
corroborated by the low vegetation response found in the HA treatment for the
separately gathered fuels data (@fig-fuel-pre-pct), as well as for tanoak sprout
basal area where the only statisticaly supported evidence of treatment
difference was between the GS and HA treatments. 

- Relevance for biodiversity?

- Douglas-fir: there was no appreciable differences detected among treatments
  either for basal area or number of stems
  - this suggests that our treatments were not growing-space limiting in terms of df
    regeneration: compare to other studies of DF regeneration
    - are we above or below the threshold for optimal df growing space?
  - Continued canopy closure could result in light limiting conditions in the
    future

- Like other studies in redwoods the least residual overstory density resulted
  in the greatest abundance of redwood.
  - RW basal area in LD (the next highest average redwood basal area) was half
    that of the GS treatment, but large ammount of variability meant that this
    difference was not statistically distinguishable from 0 at the 95%
    confidence level.
- Variability dereased with decreasing abundance
  - redwood variabiltiy was greatest
  - variability was greatest in lower density treatments: aspect?
- HA and HD treatments were very similar
- This is all suggestive of quickly declining growth rates associated with
  increasing overstory density

- Treatment differences for tanoak were relatively similar, but with less
  difference between GS and LD treatments
- Small (non statistical) difference between HA and HD likely due to un
  realistic midpoit chosen for stems less than 1 cm.
  - reflects the fact that there were more (small) tanoak stems associated with
    increasing overstory density
    - perhaps due to slower rate of self-thinning resulting from slower growth
- what would tanoak abundance be if they were not competing with redwood?

## Sprout height

## Fuel loading

### Pre-PCT 

Fuel loading found in our treatments were comparable to those found in other
studies in redwood systems. Our treatment level averages for duff and litter
ranged from 40 to 55 Mg ha^-1^ in plots that had post-harvest basal areas (in
2012) of 0 to 40 m^2^ ha^-1^. This was comparable to total duff and litter
loading found in 120-year-old redwood stands (range: 29 to 55 Mg ha^-1^) as well
as old-growth stands (averge: 50 Mg ha^-1^) and our raw average duff and litter
depth of 6.2 cm (data not shown) was similar to that found in a <30-year-old mixed Douglas-fir/redwood
stand
[@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985;@glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015]. We opted to combine
duff and litter into a single metric following previous studies that found
similar bulk densities for duff and litter and that separating the two resulted
in little difference from and average bulk density, given the wide variability
found in duff and litter depths[@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985, @finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993].

Our average total fine woody fuel loading, including one-, ten-, and one
hundred-hour-fuels (15 Mg ha^-1^) was within the range found in 120-year-old
stands (9 to 20 Mg ha^-1^, @finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993), double that
found in very young, mixed stands [@glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015], and 4 Mg ha^-1^ higher
than that found in old growth stands [@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985].

In the following I'll compare the average fuel loadings found in this study to
those found in the "old growth" and "very young, mixed" stands referenced above.

Our one-hr fuel loading which, which averaged about 1 Mg ha^-1^ was similar to
that found in the old-growth stand, but about half that found in the very young,
mixed stand. 

Our average 10-hr fuel loading was higher than in the very
young, mixed stand (3.4 vs. 2 Mg ha^-1^) but similar to the old growth stand.

Our average 100-hr fuel loading of about 11 Mg ha^-1^ was higher than in both
the old growth stands (5 Mg ha^-1^) and the very young, mixed stands (3 Mg ha^-1^).

Our average 1,000-hr fuel loading of 42 Mg ha^-1^ was somewhat lower than found
in old growth stands (63 Mg ha^-1^) as well as in the very young, mixed stands
(54 Mg ha^-1^). These estimates are accompanied by relatively high standard
errors, but it would not be surprising that State Park forest, with little to no
harvest activity would have a larger amount of large downed logs then an
actively managed forest such as ours.

Our elevated average 100-hr fuel loading may be the result of 
residual fuels left over from the harvest treatment that initiated our experiment
which would have been absent from the other sites referenced here. In the very
young, mixed stand, 100-hr fuels jumped to 10 Mg ha^-1^ immediately following a
thinning treatment. For our 10-hr fuels, it might be reasonable to suspect that
the smaller trees in the very young, mixed stand did not supply as much 10-hr
fuels because of the sizes of their branches, whereas branch shedding patterns
in the 10-hr time lags class were more similar between our stands and the old
growth ones. Our reduced 1-hr fuel loading compared to the very young, mixed
forest could be due to differing stand structures and species compositions. That
forest was composed of a large proportion very young Douglas-fir and would be
expected to have different forest floor characteristics and this notion is
supported by our finding of similar 1-hr fuel loading as in the old growth
study. Another source of possible error is differences in sampling method for
1-hr fuels. We established a cutoff where redwood particles smaller than roughly
2 mm were considered as litter, rather than 1-hr fuels. If we had counted every
redwood leaf-spray, regardless of size, we would have likely found higher 1-hr
fuel loads.

That we found similar average fuel loading in our Pre-PCT stands compared
to two studies in very different redwood forest structures is congruent with our
findings of few statistically significant differences between treatments in
terms of fuel loading. This result is common among other studies and is expected
due to the highly variable nature of forest fuels (CITATIONS). Statistical
difference at the p < 0.05 level were only found among treatments for 1-hr and
Vegetation loading, and nearly found for Duff & Litter. In all cases these
differences involved the HA treatment, but the nature of the comparisons varied
with fuel types. For instance, for Duff & Litter was lowest in the HA treatment
and highest in the HD treatment (p = 0.07). This potential difference in fuel
load could be indicative of differences in fuel moisture because forest floor
decomposition is a function of both moisture and temperature (CITATIONS). Forest
floor conditions in the HA treatment would be expected to be somewhat more moist
than the more open treatments, but potentially also warmer (due to greater light
infiltration) than the HD treatment. Small differences in forest floor moisture
can have significant implications for prescribed burning operations because
these are often conducted under marginal conditions (CITATIONS). In terms of
both 1-hr fuel loading and Vegetation fuel loading, the HA treatment was most
similar to the HD treatment. In these cases it is not surprising that a greater
density of sizeable trees would result in more twigs and less light available
for growth of vegetation at the surface. It is somewhat surprising that the HA
treatment did not reveal measurable differences in understory growth. This
result does not support our previous supposition in regards to Duff & Litter
loading, of differences in understory light (temperature) between the HD and HA
treatments. But it could be that understory growth dynamics are more complicated
than simple light availability and to this end, other researchers have proposed
exploring the potential effects of below-ground competition (CITATIONS). It was
also somewhat surprising that the modeled Vegetation fuel loading differences were not
more pronounced because, while conducting field work, GS and LD treatments were
usually much more difficult to work in due to the amount of understory growth
present in these treatments. And these conditions were also indicated by our
findings of somewhat elevated basal area of tanoak and redwood in those
treatments. Our method of calculating vegetation fuel loading
(estimated percent cover times estimated height within an estimated cylinder)
might have been overly imprecise. Additionally, given the importance of
understory light to the processes of surface fuel decomposition as well as for
understory growth, inclusion of the potentially confounding variable: aspect
might have led to better explanatory power in our models. Our plots were
established over a range of aspects, but it is plausible that differences in
aspect outweighed differences between treatments. We had hoped that the
inclusion of site and treatment as nested random effects would have captured
site and block level differences in aspect. Additionally, aspect is largely a
proxy for insolation, and this may have also varied with shade conditions (very
large trees or roadcuts) outside of the plot.

### Post-PCT

Duff and litter are not reported for post-pct stands for two reasons. First,
these are not expected to have changed significantly given the relatively short
timespan before and after PCT. Second, our sampling protocol did not make it
clear how to quantify the loading for leaves attached to recently cut branches,
especially given that these "suspended litter" particles were in a state of
active transition to the ground, as they dry, abscise, and sift through the
coarser woody fuels as they make their way to the ground. This class may deserve
more attention because of it's potentially dynamic relationship with the timing
of prescribed fires: as suspeded particles settle and begin to decompose they're
bulk density changes and bulk density is an important determinant of fire
behavior.

Crews were guided to thin to achieve the same understory conditions across all
four treatments and this is indicated by similar post-PCT vegetation fuel loads
(@fig-fuel-post-pct). Fuel differences resulting from PCT were driven by fuels
in the vegetation fuels class, i.e., growth and productivity. Vegetative growth
following thinning and harvest is an important consideration for fire informed
management. In our experiment, 10 years of growhth (followed by PCT) led to some
increase in average 100-hr fuel loading but only for the GS treatment. Ten-hr
fuels increased in the GS and LD treatments aparently as a function reducing
competition in these treatments (@fig-fuel-pct-comparison). One-hr fuels
increased most, in the GS and LD treatments, but also started out somewhat lower
1-hr fuel loading than the HA and HD treatments, which resulted in the the
post-pct fuel loading being simliar, except for in the HA treatment, where
unexpectedly low vegetative fuel loading resulted in little to no increase in
1-hr fuels after PCT, likely because much of the existing vegetation (saplings)
needed to be retained to meet the presctiption (@fig-fuel-pct-comparison).
Pre-commercial thinning resulted in little change in 1,000-hr fuels, as thinned
sapling stems were mostly under three inches, although a potential increase
observed in the HD treatment may have been a result of some previosly retained
canopy trees being cut (12 inches dbh was the prescribed upper limit for
thinning). The model selection process resulted in slightly different models
after pre-commercial thinning, compared to before thinning for a given fuel
class. These changes may be somewhat arbitrary, as the model selection process
was guided by balancing parsimony, AIC, and the production of well distributed
residuals. In a few cases, the higher values associated with post-PCT fuel
loading predictions tended towards models that accounted for greater (variation
in) variability. 

The simple method we used probably over-estimated vegetation fuel loading,
evidenced by the fact that the large fuel loading differences observed in the
vegetation class are not reflected in the increase in fine fuels. Although the
contribution of slash foliage is not accounted for, it appears our method may
have overpredicted vegetation loading by around a factor of three if we assume
that the majority of the difference in vegetation fuels should be captured by
the sum of the changes in fine fuels and the decrease in 100-hr fuels after PCT
is assumed to be the result of sampling error.

It can be seen from this analysis resulting surfaces fuel conditions are
expected to be the result of a complex interaction of productivity and
decomposition rate. Whether any of the differences we observed result in a
significant difference in prescribed or wild fire will need to be tested by
those disturbances. It is possible that the elevated 10-hr loads in the GS and
to a lesser degree, the LD treatments may represent greater fuel continuity
which could support prescribed fire operations. Likewise, the HA treatment's
lower fuel loading across classes could signify patchy fuel distribution.
Surface fuel moisture and windspeed are two variables which we did not study but
which have a strong influence on fire behavior and are also affected by
overstory density and arrangement. Given the relatively modest differnence we
observed in fuel loads, it seems likely that those unmeasured factors could have
a greater bearing on fire outcomes.
