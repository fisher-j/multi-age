## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This is an analysis of the 10-year re-measure of the Redwood multi-age
experiment which is maintained by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture
at Cal-Poly Humboldt, in conjunction with the Jackson Demonstration State Forest
in Mendocino County, California. The multi-aged experiment explores the
regeneration response of several species following different harvesting
techniques including group selection, aggregated retention, and high/low
dispersed retention. The 10-year re-measure data includes surface fuel
characterization and regeneration density.

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank my advisor Pascal Berrill and my other committee memebers,
Jeffrey Kane, and Rosanna Overholser for their long-suffering support.
Completion of my thesis would not have been possible without the administrative
support of Nona Minerva, Erin Kelly, and Eric Riggs. My field data would have
been measly at best were it not for the dedicated efforts of our field crew:
Allen Cooper, JD Wilder, Destiny Rivera, Keith Shuttle, Aidan Jack Murphy,
(TODO: who helped first year of whiskey creek data collection?)
