# Introduction

Ecological forestry which maintains a wide range of ecosystem services while
also supplying timber requires a diverse landscape of highly varied forest
structures [@apletEvenVsUnevenAged1994; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018;
@oharaSilvicultureTransformationCommentary2001] . These, in turn, require a
variety of silvicultural techniques to implement and sustain
[@oharaSilvicultureStructuralDiversity1998;
@schutzSilviculturalToolsDevelop2002]. The development of multiaged stand
structures has long been of interest to silviculturists as a key
alternative to the conceptually and logistically simpler, even-aged management
[@schutzClosetonatureSilvicultureThis1999]. Multiaged silviculture refers to the
retention of trees of distinctively different age classes, growing together
within the same stand. These cohorts may co-occur at the tree level, or
in small, even-aged patches within the stand. In the latter case, the
distinction between even- and multiaged management can become blurred with
increasing patch size, but patches are generally much smaller (often less than 1
ha) than the stands they compose. The pursuit of multiaged stand structures has
often met with mixed results [@oharaHistoricalDevelopmentUneven2002] and this
has led to the investigation of several different systems for achieving such
structures. Research into the efficacy and results associated with these is
ongoing [@beeseTwoDecadesVariable2019; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018]. One such
system that has gained popularity in recent decades is known as the retention
system, which allows for the retention of a range of tree densities, in
dispersed or aggregated spatial patterns and can be used to maintain, multiaged
stands, or convert from even-aged management
[@mitchellRetentionSystemReconciling2002].

Redwood forests offer a prime opportunity for multiaged management because coast
redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) regenerate reliably via stump sprouting and are
relatively shade tolerant. The very high leaf areas observed in these forests,
suggest their suitability for a multi-layered forest structure
[@berrillPatternsLeafArea2007; @vanpeltEmergentCrownsLightuse2016].
Additionally, with their high timber value and productivity, Redwood forests are
of keen interest to private timber producers. Despite redwood's fitness for
multiaged stand structures, the successful development of subordinate cohorts
depends on adequate access to light, and light deficiency can lead to reduced
vigor and mortality in young sprouts and understory trees
[@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988; @mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022;
@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007; @webbWhiskeySpringsLongterm2012].

Complicating redwood regeneration and sprout development is the fact that the
competing hardwood species, tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*), is also
shade tolerant and a vigorous resprouter. Tanoak is a keystone species in terms
of wildlife habitat and First Nation's cultural identities, but from a timber
production standpoint it is often perceived as a nuisance due to a lack of
market development combined with its widespread proliferation following
intensive, repeated conifer harvesting [@bowcuttTanoakTargetRise2011]. While
redwood grows more quickly than tanoak in multiaged stands, competition from
hardwoods such as tanoak reduce conifer growth and drought resistance
[@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018; @dagleyHeavyCrownThinning2023].

Throughout many of the fire-adapted forests of California, fire exclusion
combined with timber harvest has led to dense, younger stand---often comprised
of suppressed trees---proliferation of more fire-sensitive species, and an
accumulation of surface fuels [@saffordNaturalRangeVariation2017;
@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009]. This situation combined with climate change
has led to increased size and frequency of high-severity fires in many regions
[@parksWarmerDrierFire2020; @westerlingIncreasingWesternUS2016], prompting
widespread interest in fuel treatments and resilient stand structures.

This interest has seen less momentum in the redwood region, likely due to the
perceived safety of these typically moist forests from the threat of large
wildfires. Yet redwood litter is among the most flammable of conifer litter
types [@fondaBurningCharacteristicsWestern1998], seasonal drought leads to cured
fuels, especially during extended breaks in coastal fog
[@jacobsFireHistoryPerpetuation1985], and numerous physiological adaptations
suggest that redwood has evolved under fire disturbance pressure
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017]. More concretely, there have been at least six
large fires in redwood ecosystems since 2003, burning at least 189,000 ha
including widespread areas of canopy loss. Scientific consensus places the
pre-colonization fire return interval for redwood forests at 6-25 years across
their range [@lorimerPresettlementModernDisturbance2009]. It is assumed that
much of this activity is attributable to indigenous burning
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017].

There have been several studies that have quantified various fuel strata in
redwood forests. @kittredgeComparisonForestFloors1940 did so for duff and litter
in a redwood plantation. @greenleeVegetationFireHistory1983 studied fuels at Big
Basin State Park. @stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985 reported on fuels at Humboldt
Redwoods State Park. Finney and Martin [-@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;
-@finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993] reported on fuels in second-growth
redwood forests (aged \~100 years) at Annadel and Humboldt Redwoods State Parks.
@grahamStructureDownedWoody2009 reported on fuels in old-growth stands across
redwood's range. @glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015 studied fuels with and without
thinning treatments in young (\< 50 years) redwood-Douglas fir stands. No fuel
studies, to my knowledge, have been conducted in redwood forests actively
managed with multiaged silviculture, but fuel dynamics represent a potentially
important decision variable to consider when managing forest stands that may be
subjected to intentional or unintentional fire.

## Thinning effects on fuel summary

Short-term impacts of thinning on fuel loads are well-understood across various
forest types and thinning methods. However, knowledge of long-term effects is
limited [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012; @hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].
Most research focuses on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the United
States, with some studies in other ecosystems [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009;
@burtonFineFuelChanges2022; @vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023].

Opening the canopy through tree removal can increase surface vegetation
[@keyesPitfallsSilviculturalTreatment2006] like shrubs
[@odlandPlantCommunityResponse2021], young trees
[@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020], or herbaceous plants
[@vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023]. Whole-tree harvesting has minimal
short-term effects on surface fuels. However, leaving leftover branches and
debris ("slash") can significantly increase these fuels
[@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009].

Fine dead woody fuels (1-hour to 100-hour) from thinning activities typically
decompose within 10 years if left on site [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012;
@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020; @burtonFineFuelChanges2022;
@oharaRegenerationDynamicsCoast2017; @martinsonFuelTreatmentsFire2013]. More
open stands may experience lower duff, litter, and fine woody fuel loads due to
faster decomposition rates [@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020;
@keaneBiophysicalControlsSurface2008].

Thinning, unlike harvesting, aims to increase growing space for existing trees,
not establish new ones. Most fuel loading studies address thinning, with fewer
examining harvest impacts [@burtonFineFuelChanges2022;
@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

The high variability in thinning methods and their site-specific interactions
necessitate further research on different forest structures and their resulting
fuel loads [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009; @stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009;
@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

## Thinning effects on sprout growth

- [ ] In other species, number of sprouts and sprouting probability depends on
      stump size/age, but this has not been shown for redwood
- [ ] Shade tollerance of redwood, tanoak, and Douglas-fir
- [ ] Number of sprouts not related to residual overstory [@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988]
- [ ] Early sprout growth expected to be a function of carbohydrate reserves [@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007]
- [ ] Sprout growth (height and diameter) dependent on overstory retention 
- [ ] Sprouters vs seeders relationship with overstory retention
- [ ] Redwood is unique among conifers for sprouting ability
- [ ] special consideration: bear damage
