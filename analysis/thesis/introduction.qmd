# Introduction

## Multiaged management

Ecological forestry which maintains a wide range of ecosystem services while
also supplying timber requires a diverse landscape of highly varied forest
structures [@apletEvenVsUnevenAged1994; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018;
@oharaSilvicultureTransformationCommentary2001] . These, in turn, require a
variety of silvicultural techniques to implement and sustain
[@oharaSilvicultureStructuralDiversity1998;
@schutzSilviculturalToolsDevelop2002]. The development of multiaged stand
structures has long been of interest to silviculturists as a key
alternative to the conceptually and logistically simpler, even-aged management
[@schutzClosetonatureSilvicultureThis1999]. Multiaged silviculture refers to the
retention of trees of distinctively different age classes, growing together
within the same stand. These cohorts may co-occur at the tree level, or
in small, even-aged patches within the stand. In the latter case, the
distinction between even- and multiaged management can become blurred with
increasing patch size, but patches are generally much smaller (often less than 1
ha) than the stands they compose. The pursuit of multiaged stand structures has
often met with mixed results [@oharaHistoricalDevelopmentUneven2002] and this
has led to the investigation of several different systems for achieving such
structures. Research into the efficacy and results associated with these is
ongoing [@beeseTwoDecadesVariable2019; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018]. One such
system that has gained popularity in recent decades is known as the retention
system, which allows for the retention of a range of tree densities, in
dispersed or aggregated spatial patterns and can be used to maintain, multiaged
stands, or convert from even-aged management
[@mitchellRetentionSystemReconciling2002].

Redwood forests offer a prime opportunity for multiaged management because coast
redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) regenerate reliably via stump sprouting and are
relatively shade tolerant. The very high leaf areas observed in these forests,
suggest their suitability for a multi-layered forest structure
[@berrillPatternsLeafArea2007; @vanpeltEmergentCrownsLightuse2016].
Additionally, with their high timber value and productivity, Redwood forests are
of keen interest to private timber producers. Despite redwood's fitness for
multiaged stand structures, the successful development of subordinate cohorts
depends on adequate access to light, and light deficiency can lead to reduced
vigor and mortality in young sprouts and understory trees
[@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988; @mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022;
@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007; @webbWhiskeySpringsLongterm2012].

Complicating redwood regeneration and sprout development is the fact that the
competing hardwood species, tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*), is also
shade tolerant and a vigorous resprouter. Tanoak is a keystone species in terms
of wildlife habitat and First Nation's cultural identities, but from a timber
production standpoint it is often perceived as a nuisance due to a lack of
market development combined with its widespread proliferation following
intensive, repeated conifer harvesting [@bowcuttTanoakTargetRise2011]. While
redwood grows more quickly than tanoak in multiaged stands, competition from
hardwoods such as tanoak reduce conifer growth and drought resistance
[@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018; @dagleyHeavyCrownThinning2023].

## Management effects on sprouting

The most commonly used metrics for quantifying sprouting response are percent of
stumps sprouting following cutting, the sprout density or the number of sprouts
arising from a cut stump or within a sprout clump, and sprout development which
can include height and/or diameter. 

An important consideration in comparing sprout response across studies is the
time between treatment and measurement. Sprout growth in most species is
initiated by the mobilization of carbohydrates stored in the underground
portions of the tree [@deltrediciSproutingTemperateTrees2001], and differences
resulting from external conditions may not be realized early in development.
Redwood sprout clumps can consist of 100 or more stems the first year after
cutting [@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967], but rapidly self-thin in full
light [@boeNaturalSeedlingsSprouts1975]. With overstory competition, this loss
may proceed even more rapidly, possibly resulting in the mortality of the entire
clump [@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010]. Whereas the thinning of sprout clumps,
whether from internal, or external competition may last 20-30 years in eastern
hardwoods [@gouldModelingSproutoriginOak2007], this process may occur over
hundreds of years in long-lived redwoods [@oharaRegenerationDynamicsCoast2017].

Because the metrics of precent sprouting, sprout density, and sprout development
capture different characteristics of sprout response, they often vary with
factors such as species, site characteristics, overstory density, parent stump
age/diameter, and geographic province. Even when these variables are accounted
for, unexplained variation may remain between sites
[@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022; @keyserStumpSprouting192015].

### Composition

Due to their rapid initial growth, sprouting species may alter the composition
of a regenerating stand [@deltrediciSproutingTemperateTrees2001]. This can lead
to an increase in less desirable species [@keyserStumpSproutDynamics2014]. In
redwood ecosystems, redwood sprouts typically outsize the stump sprouts of
tanoak, a common associate, in the first 5 years following partial harvest
[@mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022]. It has yet to be seen how these dynamics might
change over time, or what their cumulative effect will be on the regeneration of
other species [@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018]. Various interactions
between treatments and other disturbance factors could lead to differences in
regeneration, such as in the case of deer browsing following the use of fire
[@wilkinsonTanoakSproutDevelopment1997], heavier deer browsing closer to
watercourses [@schneiderResidualStandStructure2023], or bears preferentially
damaging regenerating conifers (especially redwoods) exhibiting rapid diameter
growth [@dagleyRestorationThinningEnhances2018; @berrillTreeSizeGrowth2017].

### Sprout growth

One of the clearest relationships among sprouting species is the positive one
between sprout growth and understory light [@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018;
@knappEarlyStumpSprout2017; @keyserStumpSproutDynamics2014;
@gardinerDevelopmentWaterOak1997]. Like most sprouting species, despite
redwoods shade tolerance it requires a certain threshold of light to maintain
growth [@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010]. The effect of understory light is
weakest very early in development when growth is dominated by stored
carbohydrates in the parent stem and root system [@keyserStumpSprouting192015;
@gardinerDevelopmentWaterOak1997].

Sprout growth is also dependent on stump diameter, with larger stumps producing
more rapid growth. This has been observed in redwood and tanoak
[@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018; @harringtonPredictingCrownSizes1992] and
is common among eastern hardwoods as well [@deyModelingRegenerationOak1996,
@keyserStumpSprouting192015], but varies among species
[@knappEarlyStumpSprout2017].

### Percent sprouting and number of sprouts

It is common among many sprouting species for percent of stumps sprouting after
cutting to decline with increasing tree size or age, but this effect is known to
vary by species and may be related to site factors as well.
[@johnsonPredictingOakStump1977; @nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022]. In
redwoods, some authors have found evidence of this trend
[@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967; @wiantSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967], while
others have not [@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979;
@barretteRedwoodSproutsJackson1966]. This may be due to the very wide range of
tree sizes and ages possible with redwoods. It has been suggested that percent of
stumps sprouting may initially increase with age up to a certain point, and then
decrease with trees older than around 200 to 400 years
[@powersSproutingOldGrowthCoastal1970; @oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007].
Decreasing percent sprouting has been demonstrated for tanoak, among other
coastal hardwoods [@harringtonPredictingCrownSizes1992].

Residual overstory density may affect the percent sprouting for some species and
locales, but detection of this effect has varied across studies and is sensitive
to the range of residual basal areas observed in a study
[@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022]. Redwood studies have found this
phenomenon weak or absent [@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979;
@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988]. The number of sprouts produced by a cut stump for
eastern hardwoods is usually not correlated with overstory density
[@knappEarlyStumpSprout2017; @atwoodEffectsAlternativeSilviculture2009], and
this is assumed to be the case in redwood forests as well
[@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979; @oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010].

After cutting, 90-100% of second-growth redwoods (trees smaller than 90 cm dbh)
can be expected to sprout [@barretteRedwoodSproutsJackson1966;
@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979]. However, when larger older
redwoods are cut, their stumps are less likely to resprout; percent sprouting
among larger older trees approaches 50% [@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967;
@boeNaturalSeedlingsSprouts1975]. Among cut stumps that do sprout, survival of
all the sprouts on a stump is not guaranteed. Entire sprout clumps can die
quickly in low light environments [@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010]. The survival
of these new sprouts in each subsequent year is a function of overstory density,
especially when approaching closure of the overstory. Percent sprouting has also
been found to vary by site and regional factors
[@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022; @keyserStumpSprouting192015]. These have
not been explored for redwoods, but they represent a possible set of confounding
factors in the detection of sprouting trends.

## Forest fuels

Throughout many of the fire-adapted forests of California, fire exclusion
combined with timber harvest has led to dense, younger stand---often comprised
of suppressed trees---proliferation of more fire-sensitive species, and an
accumulation of surface fuels [@saffordNaturalRangeVariation2017;
@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009]. This situation combined with climate change
has led to increased size and frequency of high-severity fires in many regions
[@parksWarmerDrierFire2020; @westerlingIncreasingWesternUS2016], prompting
widespread interest in fuel treatments and resilient stand structures.

This interest has seen less momentum in the redwood region, likely due to the
perceived safety of these typically moist forests from the threat of large
wildfires. Yet redwood litter is among the most flammable of conifer litter
types [@fondaBurningCharacteristicsWestern1998], seasonal drought leads to cured
fuels, especially during extended breaks in coastal fog
[@jacobsFireHistoryPerpetuation1985], and numerous physiological adaptations
suggest that redwood has evolved under fire disturbance pressure
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017]. More concretely, there have been at least six
large fires in redwood ecosystems since 2003, burning at least 189,000 ha
including widespread areas of canopy loss. Scientific consensus places the
pre-colonization fire return interval for redwood forests at 6-25 years across
their range [@lorimerPresettlementModernDisturbance2009]. It is assumed that
much of this activity is attributable to indigenous burning
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017].

TODO: summarize fuel loading in various classes found by these studies

There have been several studies that have quantified various fuel strata in
redwood forests. @kittredgeComparisonForestFloors1940 did so for duff and litter
in a redwood plantation. @greenleeVegetationFireHistory1983 studied fuels at Big
Basin State Park. @stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985 reported on fuels at Humboldt
Redwoods State Park. Finney and Martin [-@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;
-@finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993] reported on fuels in second-growth
redwood forests (aged \~100 years) at Annadel and Humboldt Redwoods State Parks.
@grahamStructureDownedWoody2009 reported on fuels in old-growth stands across
redwood's range. @glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015 studied fuels with and without
thinning treatments in young (\< 50 years) redwood-Douglas fir stands. No fuel
studies, to my knowledge, have been conducted in redwood forests actively
managed with multiaged silviculture, but fuel dynamics represent a potentially
important decision variable to consider when managing forest stands that may be
subjected to intentional or unintentional fire.

### Management effects on fuels

Depending on the method used, thinning and harvest treatments may increase, or
not affect surface fuel loading. Whole tree removal results in the least
fuel accumulation but is more expensive than other options
[@hanProductivityCostWholetree2020]. Most other treatment methods
increase surface fuels [@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009;
@ageeBasicPrinciplesForest2005]. The magnitude of this increase is variable,
reflecting factors such as treatment mode, intensity, and pre-existing
conditions [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009]. Additional research is needed to
clarify the effects of these factors on short [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009;
@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009; @hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020], and
long-term changes to surface fuel load resulting from specific management
actions [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012; @hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

The majority of fine dead fuels (< 8 cm) generated by treatment activities typically
decompose within 10 years [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012;
@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020; @burtonFineFuelChanges2022;
@oharaRegenerationDynamicsCoast2017; @martinsonFuelTreatmentsFire2013]. But
live woody fuels, which respond vigorously to increased growing space, often
persist or increase over time [@keyesPitfallsSilviculturalTreatment2006]. The
nature of this response depends on eco-type and the amount of growing space
created by the treatment which can become dominated by herbaceous plants
[@vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023], shrubs
[@odlandPlantCommunityResponse2021], or small trees
[@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

Overtime duff and litter loads are frequently lower in more open stands than
stands with a more closed canopy. This may result from increased decomposition
rates due to greater insolation and increased throughfall, or reduced deposition
rates resulting from fewer canopy fuels [@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020;
@keaneBiophysicalControlsSurface2008].

Most fuel reduction thinning research focuses on ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) forests in the United States, with additional studies from other
Mediterranean and semi-arid regions [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009;
@burtonFineFuelChanges2022; @vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023]. Far
fewer studies have been conducted in coastal forests.
