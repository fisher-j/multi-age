# Introduction

## Multiaged management

Ecological forestry which maintains a wide range of ecosystem services while
also supplying timber requires a diverse landscape of highly varied forest
structures [@apletEvenVsUnevenAged1994; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018;
@oharaSilvicultureTransformationCommentary2001] . These, in turn, require a
variety of silvicultural techniques to implement and sustain
[@oharaSilvicultureStructuralDiversity1998;
@schutzSilviculturalToolsDevelop2002]. The development of multiaged stand
structures has long been of interest to silviculturists as a key
alternative to the conceptually and logistically simpler, even-aged management
[@schutzClosetonatureSilvicultureThis1999]. Multiaged silviculture refers to the
retention of trees of distinctively different age classes, growing together
within the same stand. These cohorts may co-occur at the tree level, or
in small, even-aged patches within the stand. In the latter case, the
distinction between even- and multiaged management can become blurred with
increasing patch size, but patches are generally much smaller (often less than 1
ha) than the stands they compose. The pursuit of multiaged stand structures has
often met with mixed results [@oharaHistoricalDevelopmentUneven2002] and this
has led to the investigation of several different systems for achieving such
structures. Research into the efficacy and results associated with these is
ongoing [@beeseTwoDecadesVariable2019; @noletComparingEffectsEven2018]. One such
system that has gained popularity in recent decades is known as the retention
system, which allows for the retention of a range of tree densities, in
dispersed or aggregated spatial patterns and can be used to maintain multiaged
stands, or transform from even-aged management
[@mitchellRetentionSystemReconciling2002].

Redwood forests offer a prime opportunity for multiaged management because coast
redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) regenerate reliably via stump sprouting and are
relatively shade tolerant. The very high leaf areas observed in these forests,
suggest their suitability for a multi-layered forest structure
[@berrillPatternsLeafArea2007; @vanpeltEmergentCrownsLightuse2016].
Additionally, with their high timber value and productivity, redwood forests are
of keen interest to private timber producers. Despite redwood's fitness for
multiaged stand structures, the successful development of subordinate cohorts
depends on adequate access to light, and light deficiency can lead to reduced
vigor and mortality in young sprouts and understory trees
[@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988; @mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022;
@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007; @webbWhiskeySpringsLongterm2012].

Complicating redwood regeneration and sprout development is the fact that the
competing hardwood species, tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*), is also
shade tolerant and a vigorous resprouter. Tanoak is a keystone species in terms
of wildlife habitat and First Nation's cultural identities, but from a timber
production standpoint it is often perceived as a nuisance due to a lack of
market development combined with its widespread proliferation following
intensive, repeated conifer harvesting [@bowcuttTanoakTargetRise2011]. While
redwood grows more quickly than tanoak in multiaged stands, competition from
hardwoods such as tanoak reduce conifer growth and drought resistance
[@berrillDevelopmentRedwoodRegeneration2021;@dagleyHeavyCrownThinning2023].
Meanwhile, there has been little scientific investigation into the development
of tanaok under shade
[@wilkinsonTanoakSproutDevelopment1997;@waringRedwoodTanoakStand2008].

## Management effects on sprouting
### Measures and general patterns of sprout development over time

Tree sprouting response following cutting is commonly characterized by presence
(percent stumps sprouting), abundance (sprout density), and size (height and
diameter). Interpretation of these metrics depends on the time between treatment
and measurement, as early sprout growth is largely driven by mobilization of
carbohydrates stored in the parent stem and root system
[@deltrediciSproutingTemperateTrees2001]. As a result, differences associated
with external conditions may not be evident early in development. Redwood sprout
clumps may consist of more than 100 stems in the first year after cutting
[@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967], but rapidly self-thin, particularly under
high light conditions [@boeNaturalSeedlingsSprouts1975]. Under overstory
competition, self-thinning may proceed more rapidly and can result in mortality
of entire sprout clumps [@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010]. In contrast to eastern
hardwoods, where self-thinning typically occurs over decades
[@gouldModelingSproutoriginOak2007], this process may extend for centuries in
long-lived redwoods [@oharaRegenerationDynamicsCoast2017].

Because percent sprouting, sprout density, and sprout size represent distinct
aspects of sprouting response, they vary with species, site characteristics,
overstory density, parent stump size or age, and geographic context. Even when
these factors are considered, substantial unexplained variation among sites may
remain [@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022;
@keyserStumpSprouting192015].

### Factors influencing initial sprout response

Across many sprouting species, the proportion of stumps that sprout following
cutting often declines with increasing tree size or age, although this pattern
varies by species and site conditions
[@johnsonPredictingOakStump1977; @nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022]. In
redwoods, evidence for declining percent sprouting with increasing size or age
is mixed [@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967;
@wiantSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967;
@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979;
@barretteRedwoodSproutsJackson1966], potentially reflecting the wide range of
tree sizes and ages present in these forests. Some studies suggest that percent
sprouting may increase with age to a threshold and decline in trees older than
approximately 200–400 years
[@powersSproutingOldGrowthCoastal1970;
@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007].

After cutting, 90–100% of second-growth redwoods (< 90 cm dbh) typically sprout
[@barretteRedwoodSproutsJackson1966;
@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979], whereas sprouting among larger,
older redwoods may approach 50%
[@nealSproutingOldgrowthRedwood1967;
@boeNaturalSeedlingsSprouts1975]. Declining sprouting with increasing size has
also been documented in tanoak and other coastal hardwoods
[@harringtonPredictingCrownSizes1992].

Residual overstory density may influence percent sprouting in some species and
regions, but evidence for this effect is inconsistent and sensitive to study
design [@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022]. In redwood forests, this effect is
generally weak or absent
[@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979;
@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988]. The number of sprouts produced per stump is also
typically unrelated to overstory density
[@knappEarlyStumpSprout2017; @atwoodEffectsAlternativeSilviculture2009], and is
assumed to follow a similar pattern in redwood forests
[@lindquistSproutRegenerationYounggrowth1979;
@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010].

### Internal and external factors influencing sprout development over time

Over time, sprout growth and survival are strongly influenced by competitive
conditions. Among sprouting species, sprout growth generally increases with
understory light availability
[@knappEarlyStumpSprout2017;
@keyserStumpSproutDynamics2014;
@gardinerDevelopmentWaterOak1997], although the influence of light is weakest
early in development, when growth is dominated by stored carbohydrates
[@keyserStumpSprouting192015;
@gardinerDevelopmentWaterOak1997]. Despite its shade tolerance, redwood requires
a minimum light threshold to sustain sprout growth
[@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010].

Sprout growth is also positively related to stump diameter, with larger stumps
producing faster-growing sprouts, a pattern observed in redwood
[@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018], tanoak
[@harringtonPredictingCrownSizes1992], and eastern hardwoods
[@deyModelingRegenerationOak1996;
@keyserStumpSprouting192015]. Survival of sprouts in subsequent years depends on
overstory density and competitive pressure, particularly as stands approach
canopy closure. Entire sprout clumps may experience rapid mortality under
low-light conditions [@oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010]. Longer-term sprout
persistence has also been shown to vary with site and regional factors
[@nievesStandSiteCharacteristics2022;
@keyserStumpSprouting192015], although these influences have not been well
quantified in redwood forests.

Due to rapid early growth, sprouting species can influence the composition of
regenerating stands [@deltrediciSproutingTemperateTrees2001], sometimes favoring
less desirable species [@keyserStumpSproutDynamics2014]. In redwood ecosystems,
redwood sprouts typically outgrow tanoak stump sprouts during the first five
years following partial harvest [@mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022], though the
longer-term implications of these dynamics for stand development remain
uncertain [@berrillUnderstoryLightPredicts2018]. Additional disturbance
interactions, including herbivory and wildlife damage, may further influence
sprout development and species composition
[@wilkinsonTanoakSproutDevelopment1997;
@schneiderResidualStandStructure2023;
@dagleyRestorationThinningEnhances2018;
@berrillTreeSizeGrowth2017].

## Forest fuels

Throughout many of the fire-adapted forests of California, fire exclusion
combined with timber harvest has led to dense, suppressed stands, proliferation
of more fire-sensitive species, and an accumulation of surface fuels
[@saffordNaturalRangeVariation2017; @stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009]. This
situation combined with climate change has led to increased size and frequency
of high-severity fires in many regions [@parksWarmerDrierFire2020;
@westerlingIncreasingWesternUS2016], prompting widespread interest in fuel
treatments and silvicultural interventions creating resilient stand structures.

This interest has seen less momentum in the redwood region, likely due to the
perceived safety of these typically moist forests from the threat of large
wildfires. Yet redwood litter is among the most flammable of conifer litter
types [@fondaBurningCharacteristicsWestern1998], seasonal drought leads to cured
fuels, especially during extended breaks in coastal fog
[@jacobsFireHistoryPerpetuation1985], and numerous physiological adaptations
suggest that redwood has evolved under fire disturbance pressure
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017]. More concretely, there have been at least six
large fires in redwood ecosystems since 2003, burning at least 189,000 ha
including widespread areas of canopy loss. Scientific consensus places the
pre-colonization fire return interval for redwood forests at 6-25 years across
their range [@lorimerPresettlementModernDisturbance2009]. It is assumed that
much of this activity is attributable to indigenous burning
[@varnerEnigmaticFireRegime2017].

Consistently low foliar moisture content levels have been recorded for tanaok
[@kuljianEffectsSuddenOak2010] and the foliage has been compared to that of
other sclerophyllous species such as those found in chaparral ecosystems which
are characterized by intense, stand replacing fires suggesting high
flammability, particularly with low canopy base heights
[@mcdonaldAdaptationsWoodyShrubs1981;@fryerNotholithocarpusDensiflorus2008]. And
tanoak leaf litter is among the most flammable of western hardwoods and has been
compared to that of fire adapted conifers [@varnerFiresTanoakEffects2017]. To
our knowledge, no studies have examined the flammability of live tanoak foliage
or tanoak sprouts.

There have been several studies that have quantified various fuel strata in
redwood forests. @kittredgeComparisonForestFloors1940 did so for duff and litter
in a redwood plantation. @greenleeVegetationFireHistory1983 studied fuels at Big
Basin State Park. @stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985 reported on fuels at Humboldt
Redwoods State Park. Finney and Martin [-@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;
-@finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993] reported on fuels in second-growth
redwood forests (aged \~100 years) at Annadel and Humboldt Redwoods State Parks.
@grahamStructureDownedWoody2009 reported on fuels in old-growth stands across
redwood's range. @glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015 studied fuels with and without
thinning treatments in young (\< 50 years) redwood/Douglas-fir stands. No fuel
studies, to my knowledge, have been conducted in redwood forests actively
managed with multiaged silviculture, but fuel dynamics represent a potentially
important decision variable to consider when managing forest stands that may be
subjected to intentional or unintentional fire.

### Management effects on fuels

Depending on the method used, thinning and harvest treatments may increase, or
not affect surface fuel loading. Whole tree removal results in the least
fuel accumulation but can be more expensive than other options
[@hanProductivityCostWholetree2020]. Most other treatment methods
increase surface fuels [@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009;
@ageeBasicPrinciplesForest2005]. The magnitude of this increase is variable,
reflecting factors such as treatment mode, intensity, and pre-existing
conditions [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009]. Additional research is needed to
clarify the effects of these factors on short-term [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009;
@stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009; @hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020] and
long-term changes to surface fuel load resulting from specific management
actions [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012; @hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

The majority of fine dead fuels (< 8 cm) generated by treatment activities typically
decompose within 10 years [@stephensFuelTreatmentLongevity2012;
@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020; @burtonFineFuelChanges2022;
@oharaRegenerationDynamicsCoast2017; @martinsonFuelTreatmentsFire2013]. But
live woody fuels, which respond vigorously to increased growing space, often
persist or increase over time [@keyesPitfallsSilviculturalTreatment2006]. The
nature of this response depends on eco-type and the amount of growing space
liberated by the treatment, which in turn can become occupied by herbaceous plants
[@vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023], shrubs
[@odlandPlantCommunityResponse2021], or small trees
[@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020].

Overtime, duff and litter loads are frequently lower in more open stands than
stands with a more closed canopy. This may result from increased decomposition
rates due to greater insolation and increased throughfall, or reduced deposition
rates resulting from fewer canopy fuels [@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020;
@keaneBiophysicalControlsSurface2008].

Most fuel reduction thinning research focuses on ponderosa pine (*Pinus
ponderosa*) forests in the United States, with additional studies from other
Mediterranean and semi-arid regions [@schwilkNationalFireFire2009;
@burtonFineFuelChanges2022; @vila-vilardellPrescribedFireThinning2023]. Far
fewer studies have been conducted in coastal forests
[@normanFireFuelsManagement2009], but see @wilderFuelsTreatmentsTending2025.

## Pyrosilviculture

Forest management for timber and other objectives and prescribed and wild fire
are inherently interlinked. This requires research which considers these
historically disjunct realms of research in a wholistic way. Fire informed and
fire dependent silviculture has been a hallmark of traditional forest
stewardship practices for indigenous across northern California since time
immemorial [@andersonTendingWildNative2013]. Fire informed silviculture has
also been practiced and researched in the Southeastern U.S. for around 100
years [@mitchellEcologicalForestrySoutheast2009]. The American west has been
slower to embrace this paradigm shift in thinking now termed "pyrosilviculture"
[@northPyrosilvicultureNeededLandscape2021]. It is my hope that this thesis
serves as an example of bridging the gap between the art and science of growing
trees to support multiple uses and the thinning and burning practices typically
regarded as "fuels management" activities
[@yorkPyrosilvicultureCombiningPrescribed2021]. The ability to envision these
realms of understanding as integral and essential pieces of a common forest
stewardship will lead to new insights and increase our capacity for better land
management. 

Therefore, the objective of this research was to quantify the development of
live surface fuels--the forest understory--as well as dead surface fuels by size
class and their dynamics with regard to a PCT fuels treatment with potential to
reduce fire severity. And to measure these within the context of a multiaged
silvicultural system under a range of residual overstory densities to explore
trade offs between overstory retention, new sprout development, and surface fuel
management.
