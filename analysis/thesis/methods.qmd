# Methods

## Site description

Situated within the unceded ancestral territory of the Northern Pomo, near the
coast of Norther California, the 20,000-ha Jackson Demonstration State Forest
was established in 1947 after being cut over multiple times starting in 1862.
The mission of the JDSF is to remain in timber production for research and
demonstration purposes. The predominant cover type is redwood, tanoak, and
Douglas-fir forest at elevations ranging from 20 m near the coast to 700 m
inland. The climate is Mediterranean with cool, wet winters and an average
annual precipitation of about 1150 mm. The sites that compose our experiment
were all redwood dominated with significant components of tanoak and Douglas fir
and were well stocked with trees 80 to 100 years old. All of our study sites are
between 13 and 16 km from the Pacific Ocean at elevations between 130 and 300 m,
on well-drained, sandstone-derived soils. The sites are located on various
aspects on mid to upper-slope positions (@fig-site-map), and the site quality is
classified as Site Class II [@lindquistEmpiricalYieldTables1963;
@webbWhiskeySpringsLongterm2012].

## Study design

In 2012, four treatments were replicated at four different sites. The treatments
were: group selection (GS), high-density dispersed retention (HD), high-density
aggregated retention (HA), and low-density dispersed retention (LD). The GS
treatment is composed of a circular 1-ha opening in which all trees were
removed, surrounded by a 50-meter buffer of light thinning in which less than
1/3 of the basal area was removed. The remaining treatments were applied over
2-hectare treatment units. The target post-harvest density was specified in
terms of relative stand density index (SDI) using an assumed upper SDI limit for
redwood of 2,470 stems ha^-1^ [@reinekePerfectionStanddensityIndex1933]. The
target residual relative density for the HA and HD treatments was 21% (SDI =
520), and the for the LD treatment it was 13% (SDI = 320). These densities were
chosen to balance the objectives of stand volume productions and individual tree
growth assuming a subsequent, similar harvest after 20 years
[@berrillSimulatingMultiagedCoast2009].

After harvesting, 0.2-hectare square macro plot was established in the center of
each treatment unit. Approximately 25 redwood and 25 tanoak sprout clumps that
were well distributed across the plot, were selected for measurement.
Additionally, for redwood, sprout clumps were selected evenly from those with,
and without residual standing trees.

Ten years after the initial harvest regeneration plots and fuel transects were
established within the macro plot (@fig-plot-layout). Circular regeneration
plots with a 4-meter radius were established 10 meters from each macro plot
corner, towards the plot center. Terminating at the center of each of these
regeneration plots, 10-meter fuel transects were established parallel to the
macro plot edges. Live fuels were estimated in 1-meter radius "sampling
cylinders" at the five-, and nine-meter locations along each transect.

Following year 10 measurements, all plots received a pre-commercial thinning
treatment where the objective was to release merchantable conifers such as
redwood and Douglas-fir from competition. Competing trees and shrubs were cut,
lopped, and scattered within the measurement plots and fuel transects were
re-measured.

## Data collection

### Sprout size

Sprout height data were collected during the winter at years 1, 5, and 10
following the initial harvest. Sprout heights at each period were based on the
tallest individual within a clump at the time of measurement with a height pole
placed at the same location on the ground at each measurement period. The
observer eliminated parallax by observing from a location up-slope, level with
the height of the sprout. Sprout DBH for only redwood was collected in year 10.

### Regeneration

Ten years after the initial harvest, four four-meter-radius regeneration plots
were established within each macro plot (@fig-plot-layout). All regenerating
trees (sprouts and seedlings) within the plot were recorded. Regenerating trees
less than 2.54 cm at breast height (1.4 m) were tallied by 2.5 cm size classes and the
actual DBH of all other regenerating trees were recorded. This allowed for an
estimation of sprout and seedling density. 


### Fuels

Also at 10 years after the initial harvest, fuel transects were established and
sampled according to the FIREMON protocol [@lutesFIREMONFireEffects2006], with
some adaptations that were unique to this project. This protocol is very similar
to that of @brownHandbookInventoryingDowned1974. One-, 10-, 100-hr, and 1000-hr
(or coarse woody) fuels were those less than 0.635 cm, 0.635 to 2.54 cm, 2.54 to
7.62 cm and those 7.62 cm and greater, respectively and included only dead and
downed woody fuels (not those attached to live vegetation, or standing dead).
Transect lengths for 1-, 10-, and 100-hr fuels were one, two, and four meters,
respectively. Coarse woody fuels were measured along the entire 10-meter
transect.

Redwoods, like other species in Cupressaceae, shed branchlets instead of
individual leaves. This leads to difficulty in distinguishing "litter" from 1-hr
fuels. We chose to use an estimated cutoff of about 2 mm for redwoods sprays
where larger pieces were considered 1-hr fuel and smaller pieces were considered
part of the litter layer. We did not distinguish between "leafy" and "awl like"
leaf shapes [@grahamStructureDownedWoody2009].

Live vegetation percent cover and average height were estimated in
1-meter-radius "sampling cylinders" as described in the FIREMON protocol
[@lutesFIREMONFireEffects2006]. A notable exception is that the sampling
cylinders were allowed to extend to the (average) top height of the live fuels
that were continuous within less than a meter of the ground. This resulted in
average live vegetation heights that could sometimes reach near the height of
the sprouts and average heights above two meters were estimated with the help of
a clinometer. This decision makes explicit instances when when fuels are
vertically continuous with the ground. Live vegetation percent cover was
estimated for four vegetation classes: live woody fuels, dead woody fuels, live
herbaceous fuels, and dead herbaceous fuels. Dead "live" fuels includes dead
fuels attached to live plants, or those still rooted in the ground. Particles
in these conditions are not counted as downed woody fuels when tallying fine and
coarse woody fuels along fuel transects. These fuels are, though, expected to
behave differently during combustion than live "live" fuels. Average vegetation
height was recorded for two classes: the average height of all woody fuels and
the average height of all herbaceous fuels. These estimates pertain to the
particles present in the sampling cylinder, and not the area-average, thus a
cylinder with only one percent cover, could still have an average height of two
meters, i.e., the empty space within the cylinder does not affect the average
height. The average height and percent-cover estimates are visual estimations and
efforts were made to discuss these frequently to ensure that estimates among
observers were consistent. Percent cover estimates were discrete, rounded to the
nearest class in the set: 0.5, 3, 10, and all subsequent 10 percent increments
up to 100 percent.

The depth of duff and litter was measured at one representative location within
each of the two, 1-meter-radius sampling cylinders along each transect. When
duff and litter conditions varied greatly in a single sampling cylinder, a
location was chosen to represent the average of conditions within the cylinder. 

Fuel bed depth was estimated as the average height of the fine and coarse woody
debris components within each sampling cylinder. Theoretically, this included
litter, but now duff. This estimate was not described in the FIREMON protocol,
but it was designed to be made in a similar manner as described for vegetation
heights.

## Analysis

An analysis was conducted in three stages, one for each of the three response
categories: fuels, sprout size, and regeneration density. All analyses were
conducted using R and attempts were made to document all data, decisions, and
techniques within a Quarto notebook, which is published at
https://fisher-j.github.io/multi-age. All response variables were analyzed using
multi-level models to account for the inherent nesting structure of the data,
including multiple measurements of individuals over time, where applicable.
Grouping levels were included in the models if their variance estimate was
determined to be significant based on the size of the variance and the magnitude
that inclusion of that grouping level had on the estimates and their
corresponding confidence
levels. Because the overall objective was to detect differences between
treatments, treatment was used as the primary independent variable. Model
development and selection were carried out using Akaike information criterion,
Bayesian information criterion, and visualization of (probability integral)
transformed residuals [@hartigDHARMaResidualDiagnostics2022]. Models were built
using the R package GLMMtmb, which provides a consistent framework for exploring
different response distributions and link functions as well as the ability to
model variance as a function of predictors [@brooksGlmmTMBBalancesSpeed2017].
The final model structures chosen for each response are given in the results
section.

Models were interpreted using estimated marginal means calculated with the
R package emmeans [@lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2021].

## TODO:

* what kind of predictions am I using, are they unit level or population level
  predictions?
* How and when are predictions back-transformed to the response scale from the
  link scale?
* Are these conditional predictions? Conditioned on what? Or are they marginal
  predictions? [@heissMarginalConditionalEffects]
* I would like to write my models in formal notation similar to @heissMarginalConditionalEffects:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \text{lifeExp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{i_j}, \sigma_y) & \text{Life expectancy within countries } j \\
  \mu_{i_j} &= (\beta_0 + b_{0_j}) + \beta_1\, \text{gdpPercap}_{i_j} & \text{Model of within-country variation} \\
  b_{0_j} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_0) & \text{Random country offsets from global average}

### Fuels

Fuel load in Mg ha^-1^ was estimated for 1-hr, 10-hr, 100-hr, combined duff and
litter ("duff/litter"), 1,000-hr, and live vegetation fuels at the transect
level. Any transect where a fuel type was not observed was assigned a value of
zero for that class and transect. Fuel load for 1- through 1,000-hr fuels were
calculated using the method in @brownHandbookInventoryingDowned1974. The
required size-class specific parameters (specific gravity, particle inclination,
and average diameter) were derived from a previous study where I used parameters
averaged across all of the measured plots [@glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015].
For 1,000-hr fuels, decay classes 1-3 were considered "sound" and decay classes
4 and 5 were considered "rotten" for the purpose of calculating load and these
loads were combined. Duff and litter were measured at two locations along each
transect and these were averaged at the transect level. We did not measure the
bulk density of duff and litter fuels, but based on findings in other studies in
the redwood region, we opted to combine these classes into a single fuel class,
using an average bulk density found across those studies of 7.73 Mg ha^-1^
[@finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993;@stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985;@kittredgeComparisonForestFloors1940].
Vegetation fuel load was calculated using bulk density constants of 8 Mg ha^-1^
m^-1^ for herbaceous fuels and 18 Mg ha^-1^ m^-1^ for woody components
[@gangiFIREMONDatabaseUser2006]. Live and dead components were combined to
calculate herbaceous and woody loading and these loadings were combined and
averaged at the transect level (again there were two measurements per transect)
to determine total vegetation loading. Herbaceous fuel loading was generally
very low.

### Sprout heights

Two metrics were analyzed from the sprout height data: height increment (m
year^-1^), and total height (m) at year 10. For height increment, there were two
measurements for each tree: increment for years 1 to 5 and increment for years 5
to 10. Thus, analysis of this data included `tree` as a candidate random effect.
While not making a difference for analysis results, it is worth noting that this
data was structured differently from the other datasets in that `plot` was made
a globally unique identifier, thus making explicit the nesting of plots within
sites or treatments and eliminating the need to specify this nesting structure
in the R code model formulas.

### Regeneration density

Sprout census data from our 4-meter-radius regeneration plots were converted to
basal area per acre per species. Tallies of species by size class for sprouts
less than 5 cm dbh were converted to diameters using the class midpoint (1.27 or
3.81 cm) before calculating basal area per acre. Minor species (e.g., those
other than redwood, tanoak, and Douglas-fir) were combined into an "other"
category. Missing species on a plot were made explicit by assigning a value of 0
m^2^ ha^-1^ for that species and plot. In addition to basal area, Douglas-fir
stem counts (stems ha^-1^) were modeled separately.
