# Thesis notes

- The most obvious effect was large bush/sprouts (this is not supported by the
  results)
- one-hr fuels were not comparable because of the difficulty in accurately
  calculating litter load and slash load.
- Discussion: significance of tracking fuel loads to pyro-silviculture
  - accounting for fire potential given specific silvicultural
    objectives/system (multi-aged) as opposed to just "thinning"

@mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022:
- Our study
- post-treatment basal area:
  GS: 0
  LD: 22 m2 ha-1
  HD + HA: 39 m2 ha-1

## Sprouting

Average sprouting probability across studies
- 44 - 93 in old growth depending on size: neal 1967
- 50% in old growth Boe, 1975
- 95% sprouting in second growth: barrette 1966
- 89% sprouting in second growth year 1, 69% sprouting in year 10: Lindquist,
  1979; Barrett, 1988
- Near 100%, but mortality observed in year 5 and quickly declining thereafter
  due to overstory: O'hara et al., 2007; O'Hara and Berrill, 2010

- [ ] rapid self-thinning: for oaks and redwood 
      - not related to retention (@gardinerDevelopmentWaterOak1997)
- [ ] below ground competition for resources
- [ ] In other species, number of sprouts and sprouting probability depends on
      stump size/age, but this has not been shown for redwood.
- [ ] Sprout height growth depends on stump diameter
- [ ] Shade tolerance of redwood, tanoak, and Douglas-fir
- [ ] Number of sprouts not related to residual overstory [@barrettModelThirdGrowth1988]
- [ ] Early sprout growth expected to be a function of carbohydrate reserves [@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007]
- [ ] Sprout growth (height and diameter) dependent on overstory retention 
- [ ] Sprouters vs seeders relationship with overstory retention
- [ ] Redwood is unique among conifers for sprouting ability
- [ ] special consideration: bear damage

### percent sprouting and density

- Studies in old growth and young growth
- Studies are inconclusive:
  - weak inverse relationship between residual basal area and percentage of
    sprouting (lindquist, second-growth)
  - data suggest similar relationships for number of sprouts and number of
    clumps (lindquist)
  - differing reports of percent sprouting relation to stump size or age
    - percent sprouting not related to size (lindquist, 1979; Barrette, 1966)
    - percent sprouting negatively related to size and age (Neal, 1967, Wiant and Powers, 1966)
  - Number of sprouts not related to overstory basal area (Barrett, 1988)
  - Number of sprouts may increase with stump size up to a point and then
    decrease (Oâ€™Hara, 2007) 

---

- Talk about the time until stem exclusion phase in our stands: the end of stand
  initiation stage. 

- Do we know how much was tractor harvested and how much was cable logged?
  - A mix
- How much basal area was removed?
- What is the final basal area of our treatments?

- Discuss the potential effect of increased soil heating in canopy openness.

- Its Varner that has the article about the pitfalls and perils of fuel
  reduction treatments that I should cite in reference to elevated vegetation
  loading in the more open treatments.

## 2024-03-25

I had some thoughts while riding my bike:

- [X] remember papers that talk about differences in fuels with over-story
      conditions
- [X] remember papers that talk about the importance of past management on fuels
- [X] paper that talks about lessons learned in regards to brush growing up after
      fuel treatments
