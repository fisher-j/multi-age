# Introduction

This is an analysis of the 10-year remeasure of the Redwood multi-age experiment. It was
started by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture at Cal-Poly Humboldt. The
experiment is located in the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in Mendocino County,
California. The multi-age experiment explores the regeneration response of several
species following different harvesting techniques including group selection, aggregated
retention, and high/low dispersed retention. The 10-year remeasure data includes surface
fuel characterization.
