  abstract = {Regeneration of commercial species is central to long-term success of multiaged management for wood production. We examined relationships between understory light, varying overstory tree retention, and growth of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens; commercial species) and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) stump sprouts initiated by group selection and single-tree selection harvesting in 80\textendash 100 year old mixed stands at four sites. Treatments included a complete harvest in 1-ha group selection openings, low-density dispersed retention, and either aggregated or dispersed high-density retention. Post-harvest stand density index and basal area were useful predictors of understory light. Mean and maximum understory light did not differ significantly between treatments with the same density where residual trees were retained in aggregated versus dispersed spatial patterns. However, the dispersed retention had lower minimum light levels when compared to the aggregated retention treatment. Aspect appeared to influence understory light more in dispersed treatments. At all light levels, the dominant sprout within clumps of redwood stump sprouts generally grew faster than dominant tanoak sprouts within tanoak sprout clumps. Differences in sprout height growth between aggregated and dispersed treatments were minimal. Stump size had a significant effect on redwood stump sprout height growth, with sprouts on the largest stumps growing approximately twice as quickly as sprouts on the smallest stumps. In the low density dispersed treatment, redwood sprouts outperformed tanoak sprouts by the greatest margin. Regeneration of redwood and tanoak was most rapid within group selection openings.},

  abstract = {There is concern that forest management activities such as chemical thinning may increase hazardous fuel loading and therefore increase risk of stand-replacing wildfire. Chemical thinning, often accomplished by frill treatment of unwanted trees, leaves trees standing dead for a time before they fall and become surface fuels. In coastal northern California, frill treatment is used as a forest rehabilitation treatment that removes tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) to release merchantable conifers from excessive competition. We studied fuel bed depth and fuel loading after frill treatment of tanoak along a 16-year chronosequence that substituted space for time. The total depth of fuel bed was separated into woody fuels, litter, and duff. The height of each layer was variable and greatest on average in post-treatment year 5 after treated tanoak had begun to break apart and fall. Initially, the evergreen tanoak trees retained their foliage for at least a year after treatment. Five years after treatment, many tanoak had fallen and transitioned to become fine- and coarse woody debris. After 11 years, the larger pieces of down wood were mostly classified as rotten. After 16 years, the fuel loading appeared roughly equivalent to pre-treatment levels, however we did not explicitly test for differences due to potential confounding between time and multiple factors such as inter-annual climate variations and site attributes. Nevertheless, our data provide some insight into changes in surface fuel characteristics due to rehabilitation treatments. These data can be used as inputs for fire behavior modeling to generate indicative predictions of fire effects such as fire severity and how these change over time since treatment.},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in multiaged management as a silvicultural and restoration tool in redwood forests of California. For multiaged silviculture to be successful, a new cohort of trees must first be able to regenerate underneath the residual overstory. We used annual re-measurement data from a replicated manipulative experiment in coastal northern California to determine how understory light, stand density, and spatial arrangement of residual trees affected coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and tanoak (Notholithocarpus den\- siflorus) stump sprouts regenerating after partial harvest of conifers and felling-to-waste of tanoak. Four treat\- ments (group selection, aggregated retention, low-density dispersed retention, and high-density dispersed retention) were applied at each replicate on redwood-dominated sites. Height growth of redwood sprouts was 49\% greater than tanoak sprouts across all treatments. Redwood and tanoak sprouts were sensitive to overstory density. Redwood sprouts were marginally taller under high-density aggregated versus dispersed overstory trees at the same residual stand density (39.5 m2/ha BA). Sprout growth correlated with understory light; redwood sprouts exhibited a significant increase in sensitivity to light availability from year 2 to year 6. No differences in redwood sprout growth were detected when retaining a residual tree on the same root system versus sprouts growing on a root system where all redwood stems were cut. Our finding that cutting unwanted hardwoods in tandem with partial harvesting of merchantable conifers can maintain a competitive advantage for redwood sprouts versus tanoaks is an important consideration for maintaining redwood dominance when transitioning to multiaged management.},

  abstract = {Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

  abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
