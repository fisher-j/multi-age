# surface fuel correlations

## Structure and composition

*These are biotic elements*

@keaneMappingWildlandFuels2001:
- vegetation and stand structure are two most important ecosystem
  characteristics
- vegetation classification considered one of the most important and difficult
  steps

@collinsVariabilityVegetationSurface2016:
- fine fuel loads related to canopy cover and proportion of shade-tolerant
  species
  - @lydersenRelatingFuelLoads2015
  - @fryStandlevelSpatialDependence2010 

@hudakMappingForestStructure2016 found positive correlation between many surface
fuel metrics and basal area, like 1, 10, and 100-hr fuels, duff, and litter
depth. Fuel bed depth was negatively correlated, as was shrub litter and species
richness.

@duffPredictingContinuousVariation2012: understory? species composition
(community) could explain 80% of fuel variation.

@lydersenRelatingFuelLoads2015:
- Strong relationship with Live and Dead BA
- Model explained around 1/4 of the variability- Some species specific effects:
  - Pine and white fir BA and canopy cover
- No significant of stem density. Emphasis on BA Suggests that large trees are
  more important
- Clearly defined variables and model tables
- Most predominate effects in best models were:
  - total canopy cover
  - total live AND dead BA
- variable importance factor revealed more species specific relationships not
  included in the best model
  - blk oak live BA on duff
- No 2-way interactions were significant

@chenDevelopmentPredictiveModel2017 
  **fuel model inputs**:
  - Basal area correlated with fuel load (Agee et al 1973)
  - "forest fuel type", canopy density, soil type (Bresnehan 2003)

## Site/climate factors

*Abiotic factors including management*

@keaneMappingWildlandFuels2001:
- stand history is the most important factor in fuel beds

@hudakMappingForestStructure2016:
- found number of fires and years since fire.

@duffPredictingContinuousVariation2012:
- litter fuel: time since fire, avg temp, min. cold temp.
- elevated fuel: rainfall year of last fire
- bark fuel: time since fire, NDVI

No correlation, reference in @keaneSpatialScalingWildland2012:
- @brownDownedDeadWoody1981
- Rollins et al. 2004
- Cary et al. 2006

@chenDevelopmentPredictiveModel2017 
- elevation -> temperature -> productivity
