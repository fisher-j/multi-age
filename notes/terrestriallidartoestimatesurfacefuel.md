# terrestrial lidar to estimate surface fuel

Pascal asked me if this works, I realized I don't know, but I should.

I think that he was referring to @pokswinskiSimplifiedAffordableApproach2021,
where they advocate for using lidar for regular forest monitoring. 

In @hiersPrescribedFireScience2020 they say:

Terrestrial lidar has shown to be highly correlated with Canopy Bulk Density,
total Crown Fuel weight, and Bulk density by 1-m height bins
[@skowronskiThreedimensionalCanopyFuel2011]. Establishing these correlations
depend on accurate allometric equations for crown fuel mass, and their height
distribution [@duveneckCharacterizingCanopyFuels2007].

Similarly, studies have related TLS point clouds to surface fuel and shrub
biomass [@rowellCouplingTerrestrialLaser2020]. Similarly, this depends on
developing a relationship with "3d sampled fuels"
[@hawleyNovelApproachFuel2018]. While the author was able to correlate shrub and
surface fuel biomass with derived lidar metrics, this is still a preliminary
finding, as the author concludes by acknowledging that fuel classes need to
predicted separately to facilitate meaningful fire modeling.

In sum, while its probably never too early now to start collecting lidar
monitoring data to facilitate future analysis of trends, substantial work
remains in standardizing methods for linking point cloud data to local
allometric or sample data, not to mention generating these data or allometries
in the first place.
