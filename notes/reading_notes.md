@linSaplingGrowthSurvivorship2002
- observation of the cross over effect of shade tolerance theory

@hornAdaptiveGeometryTrees1971
- basis of theory of shade tolerance

@kobeJuvenileTreeSurvivorship1995
- also cited in @forresterResponseTreeRegeneration2014 as a reference for cross
  over in shade tolerance.

So, where as Kobe found that shade tolerance consisted of a trade off between
high-light growth and low-light mortality, lin found that for forests not
affected by long winters, the trade offs growth to growth, and growth to
mortality were equivalent.

@keyserStumpSprouting192015:
- discuss self thinning of sprout clumps
  - importance of time since initiation
- 19 eastern hardwood species
- percent sprouting, sprout density, and height 1 year after harvest

  - differing from other studies, that found positive or negative relationship
    between sprout density and stump size
- sprout height relationship varied by species, but included dbh, site-index,
  and basal area in various combinations
- contradicts studies from other regions, suggests need for regional sprouting models
- for most species, no correlation between percent sprouting and tree
  size
- carbohydrate reserves obscures effect of overstory density
  - Percent sprouting (in the short term) not related to overstory density

  after repeated burning: 15 in. 
- open grown: compare to 79 in. (Harrington 1992)
- tender green shoots after repeated burning, all were browsed, no browsing in
  other treatments
- Much tanoak sprout development data for open grown and in competition with
  conifers, less known about development in shade.

@oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007:
Once a sprout clump becomes self-sustaining, subsequent sprout growth is
primarily a function of the light regime:
  In redwood: Boe, 1975; Lindquist, 2004; Barrett, 1988 Webb, 2012
  Other species: Larsen et al., 1997; Gardiner and Helmig, 1997

@hoodFuelTreatmentLongevity2020:
- No statistical differences in fine woody fuels, but there was a generally
  decreasing trend over time.
- Differences in fuel loading across treatments were relatively small, 12 years
  after treatment
- increased sunlight exposure and precip through fall increase surface
  decomposition rates
  - @keaneBiophysicalControlsSurface2008
- Most significant outcome was advanced regeneration and vegetation recruitment
  which contributed to ladder fuels, but also less desirable stand structure
- thinning and burning most effective: several references
- conditions:

@burtonFineFuelChanges2022:
- fine twigs increase, then decreased (after 20 years) in harvested plots
- leaf mass lower in harvest plots until 15 years after fire
- increase in vegetation in harvested plots, peaking at 20 years
- timber harvest resulted in higher fine fuel loads in the short term (<10 years)
- fine fuels continued increasing (post fire) for 30 years -> achieving steady state
### more 10-hr fuels, less 1-hr fuels following harvest
- 10-hr fuels 1.4 times greater in harvested, compare to:
  - @ageeThinningPrescribedFire2006 - Western US forests
  - @stephensFireTreatmentEffects2009
- less leaves and fine twigs for 10 years after thinning
  - also: @johnstonMechanicalThinningPrescribed2021
### After 15 years, harvest plots had more 1-hr fuels
- possibly due to re-sprout mortality?
- convergence of fine fuel loads after 20 years:

@burtonFineFuelChanges2022 discuss changes in fuels due to timber harvest in
Eucalypt forests.

@parresolEffectsOverstoryComposition2012 lists fuel loading values for SE
forests:
- "Stand age and basal area were generally more important than recent fire
  history for predicting fuel loads." 
- "Age and basal area were related to live fuels in a complex manner that is
  likely confounded with periodic disturbances that disrupt stand dynamics."

I'm still trying to figure out the best way to model species specific diameter
distribution models. I came across @delimaModelingTreeDiameter2015 who fit 10
different statistical models. Then, curious about Bayesian methods, found:
@bullockDerivingTreeDiameter2007. Both of these find different parametric models
perform better under different conditions. After these, I had a brief look at
@bollandsasComparingParametricNonparametric2013, who found non-parametric method
(Most Similar Neighbor) to be more reliable than parametric (Seemingly Unrelated
Regression)

I talked to Ethan about his paper and figured that I should probably read it as
well

The author of the R package, DHARMa has a 2012 paper about Bayesian methods in
ecology: @hartigConnectingDynamicVegetation2012. Therein is a figure refereing
to predicted forest size structure, and a couple of references for the same.
This led to @vanoijenBayesianCalibrationProcessbased2005, *Bayesian calibration
of process based forest models* that I wish I had time to read

## 2024-01-30

I started reading about community analysis in case I need to analyze composition
data for regenerating sprouts for my thesis. I quickly came to the ideas of
[Bray-Curtis dissimilarity](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/9281/what-test-to-compare-community-composition)
and testing these with
[PERMANOVA](https://uw.pressbooks.pub/appliedmultivariatestatistics/chapter/permanova/),
@andersonPermutationalMultivariateAnalysis2017.

### Multi-aged management

@mitchellRetentionSystemReconciling2002 discuss variable retention as it is
practiced in Canada. They emphasize the need for updated silvicultural practices
to match the shift in forest management objectives towards ecosystem function.

@noletComparingEffectsEven2018 indicates that there is not much support the
ecological benefits of multi-aged silviculture, and echos some of the same
sentiments as @apletEvenVsUnevenAged1994 regarding the need for both approaches
as well as protected areas. This same sentiment can be found in
@schutzSilviculturalToolsDevelop2002

I started off my reading in multi-aged management with:

@mumaDynamicsStumpSprout2022 followed by @oharaUnderstoryStumpSprout2007 and
finally @oharaDynamicsCoastRedwood2010, which seems to be basically a copy of
the 2007 paper.


## 2023-11-27

residence time: @cruzAssessingCrownFire2010 point to two competing sources for
residence time calculation. @andersonHeatTransferFire1969 is used in most models
for calculating Byrams fire line intensity, but likely underpredicts.
@nelsonReactionTimesBurning2003 is proposed as a better model, but it is not
used.

emperical lenght to breadth ratio elmfire reference:
@finneyChapterLandscapeFire2004, @andersonPredictingWindDrivenWild1983

@sardoyNumericalStudyGroundlevel2008 and @perrymanCellularAutomataModel2012 form
the basis of the ELMFIRE spotting model.

## 2023-11-22

@finneySimulationProbabilisticWildfire2011 Only models fires on ERC(G) above the
80th percentile. Fuel moistures are taken from a lookup table of average fuel
moistures (for the year?) "for each percentile range": 80th 90th and 97th
percentiles.

The [IFTDSS](https://iftdss.firenet.gov/firenetHelp/help/pageHelp/content/home.htm) is another source for online documentation of fire models

@liuStudyingEffectsFuel2013 fuel treatment allocation based on burn probability
resulted in lower simulated burn probability in comparison to allocation basesed
on fuel load

@agerWildfireExposureAnalysis2013 uses Fsim for burn probability and fire risk.

## 2023-11-21

@lautenbergerMappingAreasElevated2017
- long-term vs short-term fire risk planning
- references @agerWildfireRiskModeling2006 as a model monte carlo risk modeling
  system
- 250 ignitions km^-2
- One-hour fire spread simulation...
@kearnsConstructionProbabilisticWildfire2022 
- using elmfire, fires burn for a random period, up to seven days to approxiamte
  the duration of observed fires.
- suppression is not modeled explicity, but implied to some degree in how
  ignitions are modeled (based on occurences of fires >100 acres)
- use NOAA RTMA hourly time series for weather input

A host of fire models area available online as a service at the [fire modeling

I missed the Big Basin presentation about the CZU fire on 11/15, but here is the
youtube link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtdmH3KCU8s>

Criticism of the generalized liklihood uncertainty estimation procedure
@stedingerAppraisalGeneralizedLikelihood2008, led to probably its first use in
wildfire modleing: @bianchiniImprovedPredictionMethods2006. The criticism is
basically that without a formal liklihood function, the predictions are just
arbitrary.

@oakleyBayesianInferenceUncertainty2002 cited in
@volodinaImportanceUncertaintyQuantification2021 one of the papers that form the
basis of simulation model uncertainty quantification. Volodina also advocate for
the gaussian process emulator approach. This seems like the appropriate way
forward with uncertainty quantification. They cite
@kennedyBayesianCalibrationComputer2001 heavily.

@refsgaardUncertaintyEnvironmentalModelling2007 describe 14 methods of
uncertainty analysis and where they apply. Focus on simulation, but briefly
address broader (social) issues. Important techniques addressed for my project
are:
- Inverse modeling (parameter estimation): the calibration is only valid for
  predicting the outcome used in the objective function that is used for
  calibration
- Monte Carlo: genearl applicability, but distribution for all inputs and
  parameters, as well as their covariance structure must be specified.

@brownIntegratedMethodologyRecording2005 defines categories of uncertainty and a
frame work for recording and documenting them. Each data type is classified by
how it varies in time and space.

@jonesWhereFireQuantifying2004 Assesses effect of spatially explicit error in
wildfire threat indicies. Effect of DEM is low, but fuel classification and
especially weater input error have large effects.

## 2023-11-17

@bevenFutureDistributedModels1992 Describe the GLUE methodology which allows for
model calibration and uncertainty quantification in a Bayesian context for
deterministic models.

@abdalhaqEnhancingWildlandFire2005 early paper on evolutionary algorithms for
fire modeling.

@bevenFutureDistributedModels1992 Explanation of the glue methodology.

@benaliFireSpreadPredictions2017 shows that calibration on past fires can
improve predictions for subsequent fires. Only tunes rate of spread adjustment
factor. Results indicate remaining "strong limitations in modeling system." Uses
Generalized Liklihood Uncertainty Estimation.

@rochouxRegionalscaleSimulationsWildland2013 cited by Lautenberger for
"real-time data assimilation"

The Hausdorff distance is used in image detection/matching. It is the maximum
distance from any point in a set to the nearest point in another set. It is
assymetric, or directional, so the h *between* two sets is the maxium of h(a,b)
an h(b,a).

@denhamDynamicDataDrivenGenetic2012 cited by Lautenberger as first use of
Genetic Algorithm

@jahnForecastingFireGrowth2011 cited by Lautenberger defining model calibration
as inverse modeling.

## 2023-11-16

@simardMoistureContentForest1968 This is used by Lautenberger as a reference for
predicting fuel moisture. He also uses the national live fuels database for
assigining live fuel moisture.

@liuGlobalSensitivityAnalysis2015 seems to indicate that Surface fuel load is
does not have significant uncertainty for all fuel models. And found relatively
small effects for fuel moisture as well. They found consisten effects of low
heat content and surface area to volume ratio. This seems contradictory, could
it have to do with how they grouped individual components?

## 2023-11-14

@liuParametricUncertaintyQuantification2015 give a concise overview of the 24
input parameters to the Rothermel fire spread model. I should do something
similar.

## 2023-11-10

most cited paper in the geosciences is about data assimilation:
@kalnayNCEPNCAR40Year1996 very basically, data assimilation is an iterative
process of updating a prediction based on an initial estimate and estimates of
errors in observations as well as in the model.

On parametric uncertainty, three new papers, cited in both
@ervilhaParametricUncertaintyQuantification2017 and
@yuanPhysicalModelWildland2020 
- @jimenezQuantifyingParametricUncertainty2008 
- @bachmannUncertaintyPropagationWildland2002
- @salvadorGlobalSensitivityAnalysis2001 

@bachmannUncertaintyPropagationWildland2002 wonders what the comparison between
stochastic input - determinisic spread, vs models with deterministic input -
stochastic spread, and finally, stochastic - stochastic models. Uncertainty in
this study is the observed spatial variability in fuel attributes within a fuel
model classificaiton. Uncertainty calculated for each cell using partial
derivative of rate of spread with respect to each predictor (taylor series?)
resulting in a SD for each cell. Total variance was the average of variances for
each cell in a fuel type. Thus, using a combination of observed and assumed
variances on input variables, total variance in the output was estimated,
analytically, without Monte Carlo simulation.

calibration with a single model wrongly attributes model structure error to
parameter uncertainty. Because model structure is not accounted for, predictions
of outputs other than the one used in calibration are unreliable

landfire: in 2019 landfire introduced capable fuels which models fuel condition
after disturbance.

@nelsonLANDFIRERefreshStrategy2013 landfire data was updated with new
techniques. "incorporates adjustments that were required with previous versions
of the data, as outlined in @strattonGuidebookLANDFIREFuels2009" 

@scottReviewAssessmentLANDFIRE2008 assesses problems with landfire crown fuel
data. Calls for the need to include fire model calibration parameters, rather
than adjustment of sound input data. This would be nice. This document
references @scottComparisonCrownFire2006 which compares crown fire models and I
believe identifies crown fraction burned as the main cause of discrepency
between nexus and flammap.

@strattonGuidanceSpatialWildland2006 has a lot of guidance on model input
calibration, but not a lot of references.

@krasnowForestFuelMapping2009 built custum landscape files, but used "an
iterative approach to match historical fires" so it was not surprising they
achieved better results. Basically, they used calibration techniques.

@sullivanEstimatingErrorWind2001

@pintoProbabilisticFireSpread2016 hindcast a single fire. They use wrf
forecasted weather data and windninja. Fuel moisture was constant (6, 7, 8, 60,
and 90%). Wind direction, speed and relative humidity were assigned normal
distributions. Distribution of ROS adjustment factors was determined from 8 fire
perimeters where ROS adjustment was varied for each fuel model independently
(between 0.33 and 3). I believe that sampled values were for a given model run
were added globally i.e., constant added to every hour of weather data. Fuel
model perturbations seem to have been sampled independlty for each fuel model
present. They perform many runs of different simulated time lengths. They don't
clearly state how their probabilities are calculated, which is confusing because
there are many non-coincident simulated burn periods. In any case, they found
that re-initilizing siulations from observed fire locations did not improve
predictions. They didn't model spotting, which was observed as a major driver of
fire behavior.

@caiAnalysisUncertaintyFuel2019 attempted to calibrate a fuel model for their
forsts in China in @caiDevelopmentStandardFuel2014 but met with unsatisfactory
results and so undertook to determine the primary sources of fuelmodel
uncertainty through multiple sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. They show
that a sensitvity analysis is does not capture a parameters effect on the
output, because in reality, some potentially sensitive inputs are not very
uncertain. They show that fireline intensity has the greatest percent variation,
followed by rate of spread and flame length. While shrub surface area to volume
ratio was identified as an inflential variable, it does not vary greatly across
the landscape, and so was omited from final evaluation. The final values chosen
for calibration were:
- fuel bed depth
- 1-hr loading
- shrub loading
They claim that few (no) studies assess individual fuel model parameters
separtely, but rather assess sensitivtiy of outcomes to fuel models as a whole.
It is difficult to tell in this study, how exactly parameters were varied for
simulations, by pixel, or globally across the domain.

@allaireGenerationEvaluationEnsemble2020 is the precursur to
@allaireNovelMethodPosteriori2021, which is well written and covers the ensemble
simulation literature in a straight forward way.

@andersonFiregrowthModellingUsing2007 random and systematic perturbation of
weather data. They are trying to determine the effect of various perturbation
techniques on forecasted weather, using simulated fire from actual weather as
the ground truth. Random weather perturbations of forecasted weather led to
20-30% more area burned than actual weather. Overall, I'm not sure if any of
this is relevant to my study.

@parksWarmerDrierFire2020 builds on fire severity research to calculate regional
time series trends.

@samSimulatingBurnSeverity2022 Recent article refering to many recent burn

@estesFactorsInfluencingFire2017 Include existence of inversion layer and solar
radiation model in statistical model of fire severtiy under moderate conditions.
Inversion layers were determined from 3 RAWS stations above and 3 below 1300 m

assessed with a statistical test. Solar radiation was calculated using the
algorithm of Kumar et al. (1997).

@cochraneEstimationWildfireSize2012 calibrates farsite first to produce
realistic fire perimeters. Cite error and lack of validation in input datasets.
Proportional modifiers used to adjust CBH, CBD, FMC and CC) and weather
(primarily wind) "similar to stratton 2006, 2009". Calibration also accounted
for observed NBR and spread rate. Spatial probability of fire burning as a
resutl of fuel treatments. Cites Finney et al. (2007) a lot. Once calibrated,
the model was used to produce two sets of simulations (about 30 runs each) for
each fire. One with actual (treated) stands, the other with inputs modified to
represent a counter-factual no treatment scenario.

@parksFireActivitySeverity2014 1st time emphasis on "broad scale" severtiy

50,000 hectare "hexels". National parks and wilderness areas. Explores the idea
that fire is limited at the extremes of ecological gradients of moisture and
productivity.

@keyserClimateDrivesInterannual2017 make strong case for climatological controls
on high severity fire, refuing @dillonBothTopographyClimate2011. Their results
are conditional on large fire occurence, which would need to be predcited
separtely.

@parksSpatialBottomupControls2012 use Burn Probability to assess the effect of
bottom-up controls including fuel arrangement, topography, and ignition
patterns. Fuel arrangement had a strong effect on spatial pattern of Burn
Probability. Parisien, Parks, and Miller are doing lots of Fire simulation
around this time, It makes me wonder if they've moved on for a particular
reason. Here is a similar paper from Parks (2011):

@parksMultiscaleEvaluationEnvironmental2011: Use randig, a version of flammap
that includes non-random ignitions and variable winds and fuel moisture. Explain
the differenece between spatial and non-spatial inputs. Suggest that burn
probability is best analyzed at very large spatial scales 2000-3000 ha. Compare
and contrast correlations in fire behavior with mechanistic controls (i.e.,
slope and apsects effect on vegetation and moisture, and fire season length).
They also address colinearity in predictors. The scale of the spatial inputs
represents an assumption and conditions our interpretation of the results.
Randig does not include spatial varrying winds, or fuel moisture.

@zinckUnifyingWildfireModels2009 I'm not sure why I read this. I guess I had
never heard of any of these fire spread models before, but apprently fire spread
models that exist in the realms of statistical physics and ecological succession
are similar. In ecology there are over 40 fire models describing landscape level
fire patterns. Mostly they depend on time since last fire.

@finneySimulationProbabilisticWildfire2011 mentions statistical modeling with
historic data as another approach to burn severity and probability mapping, and
lists several references, but these don't seem to overlap with any of the
references I found for burn severity mapping like dillon, parks, or harvey. This
is interesting. Following up on one of the incldued references for burn
probability derived from statistical modeling:

@olbrichUnderstandingFireBehavior validated improved canopy base height
[@engelstadEstimatingCanopyFuel2019], surface fuel model selection (national
forest staff) and canopy bulk density @wolterModelingSubborealForest2021. 

It would seem that Wolter had two grad students parsing remote sensing data and
running farsite models, only to find that the "new" inputs had little effect.

The improved canopy base height data did not improve predictions of fire spread
(on average the "improved" data were very close to the land fire estimates).
Surface fuel models were selected by managers and these performed better than
thos provided by landfire, although the two estimates were correlated. Despspite
improvements, modeled fire still failed to accurately characterize crown fire
spread, especially spotting.

looking at the modeled fire perimeters, canopy bulk density improvements did not
appear to be any better than landfire data.

Searching for bayesian random forests led me to 
[this site](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/bayesian-random-forest/11795/2)

@harveyIncorporatingBiophysicalGradients2019 test sensitivity of spectral
indicies to canopy burn severity and find biophysical gradients are important to
account for is estimating the correlation. Readily available extensive data like
topopgraphy and prefire spectral data improved fit for RdNBR. In addition, stand
structure data also affects the relationship between observed fire effects and
RdNBR. Accounting for error in relationship between satelite indicies and field
burn severity encompasses as much variability as different components of burn
severity. On this point, they recommend testing burn severity relationship among
different quantiles of predicted burn severtiy posterior distribution. 

Heat index (topographic variable) has similar effect of latitude, owing to the
interception of suns rays throught the canopy.

60 - 70% explained variability seems to be the max for NBR dereived indicies for
field observed burn seveirty metrics.

They also list the sources for prepared RdNBR data.

@fernandez-guisuragaCautionNeededMediterranean2023 found the individual burn
severity metrics were better correlated with spectral indicies, depending on
vegetation community. Thus, composite burn indicies can obscure relationships
between indices and fire effects.

@thompsonVegetationWeatherExplain2009 case study of drivers of crown damage in

@soverelEstimatingBurnSeverity2010 RdNBR does not perform better than dNBR.

@millerCalibrationValidationRelative2009 use FVS data to genearte canopy cover
estiates. Use @bigingEstimationCrownForm1990 for crown diameters. Percent canopy
change and BA change don't have a strong relationship with NBR, but this could
have to do error in their estiamtes.

@uusitaloOverviewMethodsEvaluate2015 help me understand the difference between
Monte Carlo, ensemble, and Bayesian methods for quantifying uncertainty in
deterministic models. Some highlights:
- the importance of uncertainty quantification in decision making
- the cost/benefit of converting deterministic models to probabalistic framework
- Can spatio-temporal variance be used to quantify the full range of variation?
- Senstivity analysis and Uncertainty analysis both revolve around generating
  many model runs, with parameters varied either singly, or randomly drawn from
  independent or joint distributions.
  - Sensititivity is a form of uncertainty:
    @pooleInferenceDeterministicSimulation2000 
- Data-based options include bayesian networks:
  @garroteProbabilisticForecastsUsing2007 used this approach, but validated the
  model using "ensemble" prediction techniques.

@parksGivingEcologicalMeaning2019 build a model to measure Composite Burn Index
from spectral indicies. I would like to do somethig similar with crown loss.
They differentiate their study from those that try to determine the drivers of

- @cruzUncertaintyAssociatedModel2013 quantifies the uncertainty resulting from

Maybe I'll do something similar to what @normanAssessingRisksMultiple2010 did.
It was the only fire behavior example cited in

Cardil et al 2019 discuss methods of updating rate of spread models based on
observed rate of spread. This is not so helpful for me.

Distracted by a Bayesian model of fires spread that uses level set method and
whose math is far beyond me @yooBayesianSpatioTemporalLevel2022. I think it
works by calibrating on subsequently observed perimeters so is not immediately
useful for prediction.

@ritterVerticalHorizontalCrown2023 Tested the effect of horizontal and vertical
continuity (ladder fuels and clumps) on % canopy burned, including percent large
tree canopy burned. They found horizontal connectivity is important in addition
to vertical. Reinforced importance of CBD and midstory ladder fuels. These
findings are similar to @ritterRestorationFuelHazard2022.

@duffRevisitingWildlandFire2017 nice compilation of relevant fuel attributes and

Not immediately useful.

@beggUncertaintyVsVariability2014 revealed to me that a uncertainty is just what

who found subcanopy microclimate has strong influence on fuel moisture and
temperature, and thus, decomposition rates.

@mccarleyComparisonMultitemporalAirborne2022 compared FCCS and lidar for
estimating surface fuels and found that lidar captured variability not
detectable with FCCS. Selected a small set of lidar variables for predicting
total fuel loads with random forests algorithm. References include:

**Lydersen 2015 Relating Fuel Loads**

- Strong relationship with Live and Dead BA
- Model explained around 1/4 of the variability- Some species specific effects:
  - Pine and white fir BA and canopy cover
- No significant of stem density. Emphasis on BA Suggests that large trees are
  more important
- Clearly defined variables and model tables
- Most predominate effects in best models were:
  - total canopy cover
  - total live AND dead BA
- variable importance factor revealed more species specific relationships not
  included in the best model
  - blk oak live BA on duff
- No 2-way interactions were significant

**Jackubowski et al 2013**

Tried many combinations of stack of lidar and RGB imagery to predict both fuel
models and fuel parameters using a number of different techniques including
regression and machine learning. Fuel model classification accuracy was not
great, around 45% for the Scott and Burgan 40, usig either lidar + MNF data or
PCA lidar+imagery data. Using more general classes (from anderson 16, SH TU TL)
they had around 75% accuracy using SMO (related to SVM). For estimating
individual fuel metrics, there were higher correlations with canopy and shrub
metrics. Their "best" results were distributed across dataset-algorith
combinations. SMO was often the best. Linear regression performed well with
"easy" variables like canopy height and basal area. They didn't even report
results for dead surface fuels, because of low accuracy.

I've been vaguely considering using a Dirichlet based distribution for jointly
modeling species distributions, but am not really sure how to do this. These two
references deal with latent Dirichlet allocation.

- @keaneSpatialScalingWildland2012
  - need to incorporate variability into fuel maps
  - very complex/intensive sampling design
  - used firemon protocol
  - recommendations:
    - sampling fuel size classes that accurately capture meaningful
      distributions rather than those prescribed by fire models
    - similarly, sampling scale ("four static nested sampling frames") was not
      appropriate for all fuel classes
      - "logs should have been sampled at 5, 10, and 15 m distances"
    - Found no [[surface fuel correlations]] with stand structure or composition



## 2023-09-07

This morning I finished reading (listening to) @galeForestFireFuel2021, which
contains a great wealth of references, enough to probably keep me busy for the
next two years.

Sidetracked again! The rabbit hole consumes. I added these papers:

- @hudakNearestNeighborImputation2008 *I hadn't realized that Hudak was involved
  with this predicting stand characteristics from lidar*
- @hudakMappingForestStructure2016
- @chenStratabasedForestFuel2016 *Methods developed for
  @chenDevelopmentPredictiveModel2017, terrestrial lidar and point cloud
  classification*

and re-discovered these:

- @whiteModelDevelopmentApplication2017 *Canadian guide for foresters to augment
  inventories with lidar area-based approach*
- @maltamoPredictingTreeDiameter2014 *book chapter from the experts*


## 2023-09-06

I got sidetracked by two ideas:
- variability vs uncertainty
  - @beggUncertaintyVsVariability2014
  - <https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/551271/332632>
- and Gaussian process models vs K-nearest neighbors
  - @fathabadiComparisonBayesianKNearest2022 
    - this paper also used several metrics to quantify uncertainty including:
      - Prediction Interval Coverage Probability indicates less uncertainty
        (greater efficiency?) when closer to the nominal confidence level (e.g.
        95%)
      - Lower Mean Prediction Interval Widths and Average Relative Interval
        Lengths also indicate greater efficiency.

@collinsVariabilityVegetationSurface2016:
"Fine surface fuel loads in our study sites were positively associated with
canopy cover and proportion of shade-tolerant tree species. These are the same
variables that were connected to greater fine fuel loads in a long-fire
suppressed mixed-conifer forest in the central Sierra Nevada (Lydersen et al.,
2015), as well as in an old-growth Jeffrey pine-mixed-conifer forest in Baja
California, Mexico (Fry and Stephens, 2010)"

Used the following structure and composition variables:
- Total BA
- BA proportion by spp.
- total tree density
- tree density by spp.
- density by dbh class
  - 10 - 30.4 cm
  - 30.4 - 61
  - >61
- canopy cover
- shrub cover

Used the following site variables:
- Elevation
- slope (%)
- aspect (Parker (1982))
- Topographic relative moisture index
- Actual Evapotranspiration
- Annual climatic water deficit
- time since fire
- topographic position
  - valley bottom
  - gentle slope
  - steep slope
  - ridge

Used *Conditional Inference Trees*: @hothornCtreeConditionalInference, a recursive
partitioning technique that controls for overfitting and selection bias towards
covariates with many possibilities.

  - using a combined RGB imagery and lidar predictors for supervised classification
  - of fuel models.

- @chenDevelopmentPredictiveModel2017 
  **fuel model inputs**:
  - Basal area correlated with fuel load (Agee et al 1973)
  - "forest fuel type", canopy density, soil type (Bresnehan 2003)
  - elevation -> temperature -> productivity
  - This study:
    - years since fire
    - litter depth  
    - canopy density (%)
    - elevation  
    - aspect
    - slope
    - forest type (damp/dry)

## 2023-09-05

Today I looked at @banerjeeBayesianModelingLarge2012 and
@babcockGeostatisticalEstimationForest2018 contemplating Bayesian spatial
models. Both of these deal with forest biomass.

## 2023-09-04


@keaneMappingWildlandFuels2001:
- Hardy et al. 2001, fuel models assigned to cover types described fuels based
  on stand structure
- Sandberg 2001, advances in fuel modeling
- fine scale maps essential for prescribed fire planning
- within stand fuel variability can equal landscape variability. They list many
  sources of variability. I wonder if these, known or unknown, could be
  incorporated into a fuel model: primary production, species longevity, a
  mortality model, a wind recruitment model, etc.
- stand history is the most important factor in fuel beds
- brown and Bevins (1986) few differences between cover and site due to stand
  histories
- fuel models do not reflect actual fuel loading as much as parameters that
  result in the expected fire behavior in a given fuel type
- creating a fuel model requires experience in both fire and fuels... Experience.
  This also makes the process subjective. Practitioners may disagree about which
  fuel model is correct. "more of an art than a science."
- fuel layers must be "mapped in parallel so they are congruent," this sounds
  like an argument for larger, more complex Bayesian models.
- Due to expense of data collection, we should try to achieve multiple
  objectives simultaneously. Resulting data should be useful for a variety of
  purposes: ecological, timber, fire, smoke, etc. Also, standardized
  methodologies could make data sets inter operable.
- categorizes strategies into direct, indirect, and biophysical modeling.
- advocates for "triplet approach"
  - biophysical settings
  - species composition
  - vertical stand structure
- vegetation classification considered one of the most important and difficult
  steps
- stands with same composition and structure and site conditions can have very
  different fuel models
- vegetation and stand structure are two most important ecosystem
  characteristics

### Montagnes et al. 2021 - writing backwards

After doing your data analysis, when starting to write a manuscript, they
recommend a writing process as follows:
- take-home message
- results
- methods
- discussion and introduction
- abstract -> title

## 2023-09-01

I start reading @marcozziSensitivityLidarDerived2022 in order to further clarify
the question about [[#terrestiral lidar]] for Pascal. The introduction reminds
me that @skowronskiThreedimensionalCanopyFuel2011 used areal and terrestrial
based lidar to predict plot level Canopy Bulk Density, Canopy Fuel Weight, and
Canopy Bulk Density in 1-meter height bins, based on work by
@duveneckCharacterizingCanopyFuels2007, in which they destructively sampled the
target species and constructed allometric equations for mass of total foliage
and small branches. CBD and CBD_bin are then calculated using an [undocumented
5th order polynomial] for determining the cumulative distribution of mass over
tree crown length. This seems to be a gap in the literature, people always cite
@scottAssessingCrownFire2001, who in turn cite @sandoMethodEvaluatingCrown1972,
who used cones for tree crown shapes for the purpose of determining proportion
of mass in each height bin.

I would like to contact Matthew J. Duveneck to ask him about this.

Anyway, @skowronskiThreedimensionalCanopyFuel2011 found good agreement between
between ground-based lidar metrics and CFW, CBD, and CBD_bin. Of course
allometric equations to predict Canopy Fuel Weight, and weight by height
distributions are required first.

## 2023-08-31

These first papers started with questioning that
[[surface fuel correlations]] This lead to several other papers, and
further questions about spatial variability.

- @collinsVariabilityVegetationSurface2016
  *Statistical relationship between surface fuels and forest structure*
- @ottmarUsingFinescaleFuel2012 *I only read the title, but it seems
  interesting*

Along the way, I ran into some fuel mapping papers:

- @mutluMappingSurfaceFuel2008

- @chenDevelopmentPredictiveModel2017 

- including this review: @galeForestFireFuel2021 

### terrestiral lidar

Then, I tried to answer to Pascals question about using
[[terrestrial-lidar-to-estimate-surface-fuel]].

- I briefly looked at @loudermilkLinkingComplexForest2012 they found continuity
  and heterogeneity to be the best predictors of fire behavior on small scales.

- @rowellUsingSimulated3D2016 *Compares lidar derived height model to a height
  model derived from a 3d plant model, the actual lidar height modeling was done
  for another paper for the RxCADRE experiments, listed next*

- @rowellDevelopmentValidationFuel2015 *Lidar fuel heights did not match field
  observed heights, suggests future work will need to translate heights into
  fuel metrics that are useful for fire modeling* 

- @rowellCouplingTerrestrialLaser2020  *lidar porosity, and surface area metrics
  were used to predict biomass because occupied volume was not well correlated
  with measured biomass. Validation depended on voxel sampling.*

- Eric Rowell has a doctoral thesis about this:
