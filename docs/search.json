    "text": "4.1.1 Basal area\nComposition of regeneration in terms of total basal area of each species was modeled as a gamma distribution with a log link with fixed effects for treatment, species, and their interaction and random effects for sites and macro-plots. Dispersion was modeled separately as a function of species, using a log link and the rate of zeros was modeled using the logit link, for each species (Listing 4.1).\n\n\n\nListing 4.1\n\n\n\n\nFamily: Gamma (log) \nConditional: ba_ha ~ treat * spp + (1 | site/treat)  \nDispersion: ~spp (log) \nHurdle: ~spp (logit) \n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this model, we would expect five times as much basal area of other species in LD compared to HA (p = 0.034), and interestingly, six times more other species basal area in HD compared to HA (p = 0.014, Figure 4.1).\nWe expect 5 times more redwood regeneration basal area in the GS treatment compared to HA (p = 0.03), and 7 times compared to HD (p = 0.02).\nFor tanoak, we expect about twice as much regeneration basal area in the GS treatment compared to HA (p = 0.03).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Basal area (m2 ha-1) modeled at the vegetation plot level for four harvest treatments and four species classes (n = 16).

    "text": "4.2 Sprout heights\n\n4.2.1 Height increment\nThe selected height increment model used a normal response distribution on the identity link. It included treatment, growth period, species, and the interaction of species and growth period as fixed effects. A random intercept was included for tree (multiple observations) and macro-plot, and a random slope was included for species. The dispersion parameter for the response was modeled (with a log link) as a function of treatment, growth period, species and all three-way interactions (Listing 4.3).\n\n\n\nListing 4.3\n\n\n\n\nFamily: gaussian (identity) \nConditional: ht_inc ~ treat + year * spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot)  \nDispersion: ~spp * year * treat (log) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe model selected based on AIC lacks a treatment x species interaction, suggesting that there is not evidence that treatments affected species differentially. It also lacks a treatment x year interaction. This means that there was not enough evidence to support that treatment was related to changes in growth rate.\nThe presence of treatment in the model (0.001 ≤ p &lt; 0.03) suggests that the levels of treatment were associated with different growth rates across species and years. And the species x year interaction (p &lt; 0.001) suggests changes in growth rates are different for redwood and tanoak (Figure 4.3).\nAveraging over growth periods, treatment specific height increments for redwood ranged from 0.66 to 0.86 m yr-1, and for tanoak, from 0.29 to 0.49, with the slowest growth in the HD treatment and the fastest in the GS treatment. Height increment was greater in the GS treatment than the HA and HD treatments by about 0.19 m yr-1 (p &lt; 0.001). The LD treatment was intermediate, but not statistically distinguishable from the other treatments (0.13 &lt; p &lt; 0.28).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Estimated marginal means for the effect of harvest treatment on redwood and tanoak sprout height increment, averaged over two growth periods, ten years after harvest. Gray bars represent confidence intervals and statistical significance (α = 0.05) is indicated by non-overlapping blue arrows.\n\n\n\n\n\nRedwood growth slowed from 0.80 to 0.67 m yr-1 in the second period and tanoak slowed from 0.39 to 0.34 m yr-1.\nRedwood grew faster than tanoak, but slowed down more relative to it in the second period. Height increment for redwood was 0.42 m yr-1 greater in the first period and 0.33 m yr-1 greater in the second period than tanoak height increment (Figure 4.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Estimated marginal means for the effect of growth period on redwood and tanoak sprout height increment, averaged over four harvest treatments, from years 1 to 5, and years 5 to 10 after harvest, plotted alongside actual data. Gray bars represent confidence intervals and statistical significance (α = 0.05) is indicated by non-overlapping blue arrows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Height at year 10\nSprout heights at year 10 were modeled with a normal response and a log link. The best model included species and treatment, but no interactions in the fixed effects. This suggests that treatments do not affect species differentially. It also included a model for dispersion (log link) that had species, treatment, and their interaction as predictors (Listing 4.4).\n\n\n\nListing 4.4\n\n\n\n\nFamily: gaussian (log) \nConditional: ht ~ treat + spp + (0 + spp | plot)  \nDispersion: ~spp * treat (log) \n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the best model did not contain a species x treatment interaction, comparisons between treatments is the same for both species. The GS treatment resulted in greater heights in year 10 than the other treatments (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.04). Predicted mean height for redwood ranged from 10.29 m in the GS treatment to 6.16 m in the HD treatment. For tanoak, predicted mean height ranged from 5.12 in the GS treatment to 3.04 in the HD treatment. Predicted mean heights followed the pattern GS &gt; LD &gt; HA &gt; HD (Figure 4.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Predicted mean height and 95% confidence intervals (gray bars) for redwood and tanoak stump sprouts 10 years after harvest using four different harvest treatments.

One-hour fuels were generally around 2.4 Mg ha-1, but the HA treatment had around half of that amount (p = 0.01 — p = 0.02). The GS treatment had the greatest 10-hr fuel loading with 8.8 Mg ha-1, which was about 1.6, 2.3 and 2.9 times greater than the LD, HA, and HD treatments respectively (p = 0.03, p &lt; 0.001, for the others, respectively). The LD treatment also had about 1.7 times more 10-hr fuels that the HD treatment (5.4 vs. 3 Mg ha-1, p = 0.001). Hundred-hour fuels were also greatest in the GS treatment, with an average of about 19 Mg ha-1, which was about 2.6 times greater than in the HD treatment (7 Mg ha-1, p &lt; 0.001). Thousand-hour fuels were greatest in the HD treatment, with 80 Mg ha-1, which was about 2.7 times greater than the LD and HD treatments (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Fuel loading for live vegetation was similar across treatments at around 2.5 Mg ha-1. The pre-post vegetation difference was greatest in the GS treatment at about 31 Mg ha-1, which was 2.5 and 2.8 times the HD and HA treatments, respectively (p ≈ 0.01).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Estimated marginal means (black dots) confidence intervals (gray bars) and comparisons (blue arrows) of fuel loading across four treatments for six different fuel-class models.
