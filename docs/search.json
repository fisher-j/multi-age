    "text": "Abstract\nThis is an analysis of the 10-year re-measure of the Redwood multi-age experiment. It was started by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture at Cal-Poly Humboldt. The experiment is located in the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in Mendocino County, California. The multi-age experiment explores the regeneration response of several species following different harvesting techniques including group selection, aggregated retention, and high/low dispersed retention. The 10-year re-measure data includes surface fuel characterization.",

    "text": "1.1 Data entry\nData was entered using Excel and exported as a UTF-8 csv. The file format (Figure 1.3) was defined to resemble the physical datasheets as closely as possible, while maintaining data integretity and facilitating ease of input. There is one file for each macro plot (or replicate = site + treatment combination).\nEach file includes sections for different tables, and these are separated by a line that contains only a single hashtag (e.g., “#duff_litter_fbd”) in lowercase letters with underscores for spaces. In Excel, the #hashtag should go in the first cell of a row, with nothing esle in the row. There should be no blank rows before or after hashtags. The table sections used don’t correlate 1:1 with physical datasheet tables. For instance, columns for “metermeark1” and “metermark2” were added to reflect the fact that initially we sampled duff, litter and vegetation density (transect stations) at 5 and 10 m, but later we moved the stations to 5 and 9 m. The “1” and “2” following repeated variable names refers to one of these locations along the transect. The function used to wrangle these data matches rows based on transect number and columns based on column names. Thus, it is possible to rearrage the rows or columns within each section as long as column names are kept consistent and data for each transect have the same transect number. Following are the section and column labels used for each section of the plot data entry form with any notes regarding their format. A complete description of the data varialbes can be found in Section 1.3.\nAn R function is used to parse this file into individual tables. As part of this process, all the table sections whose rows have a 1:1 relationship with transects are combined into one wide table, based on the transect column.\nCode\nsource(\"./scripts/test_funs.r\")\n\n# file &lt;- \"../data/1_fuel_camp6_gs.csv\"\n\n# This function processess one datasheet and returns three tables that can\n# be combined with corresponding tables from other data sheets\nwrangle_datasheet &lt;- function(file) {\n  con &lt;- file(file, encoding = \"UTF-8\")\n  lines &lt;- readLines(con)\n  close(con)\n\n  # Remove BOM if it exists &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/67906611&gt;\n  lines[1] &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\xef\\\\xbb\\\\xbf\", \"\", lines[1], useBytes = TRUE)\n\n  # These are the sections I want to extract\n  to_get &lt;- c(\n    \"site_data\", \"transects\", \"duff_litter_fbd\", \"vegetation\",\n    \"woody_species\", \"coarse_woody_debris\"\n  )\n  # sections are defined by line with only a hashtage (#section)\n  section_pattern &lt;- \"^#(\\\\w+).*$\"\n\n  # find hashtags and get the data from the next line to the line\n  # before the next hashtag\n  section_breaks &lt;- grep(section_pattern, lines)\n  section_start &lt;- section_breaks + 1\n  section_end &lt;- c(section_breaks[-1], length(lines)) - 1\n  section_names &lt;- gsub(section_pattern, \"\\\\1\", lines[section_breaks])\n\n  sections &lt;- purrr::map2(section_start, section_end, \\(x, y) c(x, y)) |&gt;\n    setNames(section_names) |&gt;\n    (`[`)(to_get) |&gt;\n    purrr::map(\\(x) lines[seq.int(x[1], x[2])]) |&gt;\n    # collapse sections to strings so they can be read as if they were files\n    purrr::map(\\(x) paste(x, collapse = \"\\n\")) |&gt;\n    # leave empty column names so they can be removed\n    purrr::map(\\(x)\n      readr::read_csv(x,\n        show_col_types = FALSE,\n        name_repair = \"minimal\",\n        progress = FALSE\n      )\n    ) |&gt;\n    # Remove empty columns\n    purrr::map(\\(x) x[!names(x) %in% \"\"])\n\n  # I'm going to combine these into a wide table because each row is a transect.\n  # Further data wrangling will require expanding the stations within transecs.\n  # also need to make sure the rows have site data and transect ids for the\n  # coarse woody debris.\n  transect_data &lt;- c(\n    \"transects\", \"duff_litter_fbd\", \"vegetation\", \"woody_species\"\n  )\n\n  transects &lt;- sections |&gt;\n    (`[`)(transect_data) |&gt;\n    purrr::reduce(dplyr::left_join, by = \"transect\") |&gt;\n    # differentiate between transect lenghts and particle counts\n    dplyr::rename_with(\\(x) paste0(x, \"_count\"), ends_with(\"hr\")) |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n      sections$site_data[c(\"phase\", \"site\", \"treatment\")],\n      .before = corner\n    ) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(-transect)\n\n  coarse_woody_debris &lt;- sections$coarse_woody_debris |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n      sections$site_data[c(\"phase\", \"site\", \"treatment\")],\n      .after = transect\n    ) |&gt;\n    dplyr::left_join(\n      sections$transects[c(\"transect\", \"corner\", \"azi\")]\n    ) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(c(phase, site, treatment, corner, azi, dia, decay))\n  \n  \n  plots &lt;- sections$site_data |&gt;\n    # differentiate between transect lenghts and particle counts\n    dplyr::rename_with(\\(x) paste0(x, \"_length\"), ends_with(\"hr\"))\n\n  # I'll add a check to make sure that all transects and plots are unique\n  warn_duplicates(transects, phase, site, treatment, corner, azi)\n  warn_duplicates(plots, phase, site, treatment)\n\n  # Final output with three tables.

This will require extra work at analysis time to expand the data variables which are followed by a “1” or “2”, which represent different stations (Section 1.3) on the same transect. To analze these data, they will first need to be pivoted into a longer format, where the station (1 or 2) becomes an explicit column.",

This makes sense given the logging.\nTotal fine fuel loading (onetenhundhr) was similar to other studies, but apprently with more hundhr particles.\nThoushr fuels are notoriously variable. Those on our sites were more consistent and within the middle of the range of other reported values.\nWoody vegetation was much higher than in the one other reported study. That study was in old-growth redwoods. Our values include tree sprout vegetation, which can be several times taller than evergreen huckleberry and much bushier than understory tanoak saplings. Stuart did mention the presence of “nearly inpenetrable [evergreen huckleberry] thickets.” Stuart (1985) found good correlation of live fuels (which included leaves and “twigs”) with basal diamter for both huckleberry and tanoak saplings. The simple scaling factor and/or the occular estimates we used may be biased.",

Ten years after harvest, we would expect 1-hr fuels to be dominated by twigs and branches falling from live crowns and there is ostensibly a greater crown volume in the HA and HD treatments. Duff and litter may be slightly higher in the HD treatment, compared to the others. For live fuels, there appears to be a decreasing trend from GS &gt; LD &gt; HA & HD. Most of live fuel is due to regenerating sprouts. The difference in sprout growth in high vs. low light environments was readily apparent in the field.\nTen-hr and 100-hr, and 1000-hr fuels do not reveal an obvious trend.

The raw data for each loading variable is clearly not normally distributed Figure 4.7.\n\n\nCode\nmyqqplot &lt;- function(data, var) {\n  data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(sample = {{ var }})) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line() +\n  facet_grid(class ~ treatment, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Theoretical quantiles\", y = \"Sample quantiles\",\n    title = \"Normal Q-Q Plot\"\n  )\n}\n\nload2(\"long\", \"pre\") |&gt;\n  myqqplot(load)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Naive qq plot of loading variables.

I’m going to assume what we are interested in the distribution of data within groups (treatments).\nI attemped to model the distribution of our conditional response data (fuel size class by treatment), but it mostly didn’t work.\nOur data is non-negative (contains zeros) continuous (for the most part) and highly variable in terms of skew and kurtosis. The presence of zeros, makes using the Gamma distribution more difficult. One possibility is a hurdle gamma, or Zero-adjusted Gamma.\nThe following show where our data lies in terms of kurtosis and skewness compared to other common distributions. It looks somewhat Gamma-ish?\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", treatment, all_of(load_vars)) |&gt;\n  split(~class) |&gt; map(~split(.x, ~treatment))\n\n# imap_dfr(d, \\(x, y) tibble(class = y, treatment = names(x) )) |&gt;\n#   with(paste0(\"Treatment \", treatment, \", fuel class \", class)) |&gt;\n#   cat(sep = \"\\n\")\n\n# par(mfrow = c(2,2))\nwalk(d, ~ walk(.x, \\(x) fitdistrplus::descdist(x$load, boot = 111)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Treatment gs, fuel class onehr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Treatment ha, fuel class onehr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Treatment hd, fuel class onehr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Treatment ld, fuel class onehr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Treatment gs, fuel class tenhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Treatment ha, fuel class tenhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Treatment hd, fuel class tenhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h) Treatment ld, fuel class tenhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Treatment gs, fuel class hundhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(j) Treatment ha, fuel class hundhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(k) Treatment hd, fuel class hundhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(l) Treatment ld, fuel class hundhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(m) Treatment gs, fuel class dufflitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(n) Treatment ha, fuel class dufflitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(o) Treatment hd, fuel class dufflitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p) Treatment ld, fuel class dufflitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(q) Treatment gs, fuel class thoushr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(r) Treatment ha, fuel class thoushr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(s) Treatment hd, fuel class thoushr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(t) Treatment ld, fuel class thoushr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(u) Treatment gs, fuel class veg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) Treatment ha, fuel class veg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(w) Treatment hd, fuel class veg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(x) Treatment ld, fuel class veg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Skewness and kurtosis for fuel classes within treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Zero-adjusted Gamma\nI’ll try using the gamlss package, which fits models “where all the parameters of the assumed distribution for the response can be modelled as additive functions of the explanatory variables.”\nI’m not really sure how it works, but I know if will allow me to fit a model assuming a gamma distribution, while modeling the zeros separately. First I fit a model, then I get the estimated distribution parameters, then I plot the density curve over a histrogram (scaled to density). This looks promising to me.\n\n\nCode\n# Zero adjusted Gamma distribution fit to histograms\nplot_zaga &lt;- function(i, d) {\n  m1 &lt;- gamlss::gamlssML(d, family = gamlss.dist::ZAGA())\n  hist(d, prob = TRUE, main = i, breaks = 20)\n  curve(gamlss.dist::dZAGA(x, mu = m1$mu, sigma = m1$sigma, nu = m1$nu), from = min(d), to = max(d), add = TRUE)\n}\n\nplot_zaga_class &lt;- function(data, class_name) {\n  if(missing(class_name)) {\n    class_name &lt;- as.character(substitute(data))\n    class_name &lt;- class_name[length(class_name)]\n  }\n  par(mfrow = c(2,2))\n  iwalk(data, ~plot_zaga(.y, .x))\n  mtext(class_name, cex = 1.6, side = 3, line = -2, outer = TRUE)\n}\n\nd2 &lt;- d |&gt; map(~ map(.x, \"load\"))\niwalk(d2, ~plot_zaga_class(.x, .y))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Poisson fit of count data\nAll of the woody debris can be viewed as count data, and mean diameter.

Corners (and thus transects) are nested within plots, and plots are within treatments. Each plot received a different treatment. What I’m not clear about is: should I include a random variable for plots, if I’m including a fixed effect for treatment?\nThere are also question about at what level to summarize/model the data. I’ve already averaged stations within transects for several variable that were collected at the station level (two within each transect).

Follow up with linear discriminant analysis, or multiple one-way anovas dependidng on research question. Using a Bonferroni correction for rejecting the null of alpha / m, for m hypothesis, we get an alpha of 0.008 for an alpha of 0.05 and 6 tests.\nThis suggests that it is unlikely that all treatemnts are equal.\n\n\nCode\nload_vars &lt;- c(\"onehr\", \"tenhr\", \"hundhr\", \"dufflitter\", \"thoushr\", \"veg\")\ntl &lt;- load2(\"wide\", \"pre\", treatment, all_of(load_vars))\nmyexpr &lt;- expr(cbind(!!!syms(load_vars)) ~ treatment)\ntest1 &lt;- do.call(\"manova\", list(myexpr, data = quote(tl)))\nsummary(test1)\n\n\n           Df  Pillai approx F num Df den Df    Pr(&gt;F)    \ntreatment   3 0.35947   2.7454     18    363 0.0001889 ***\nResiduals 124                                             \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Multiple one-way anovas\nOne way anova (using the welch test) can either assume constant variance or not. A levene test (using median) indicates onehr, tenhr, and veg may all have different variances between groups.\nThe one-way anova test results are the same though between equal and unequal variance assumptions. These tests support the notion that we can’t assume that the mean vegetatvie and onehr fuel loading are equal across all treatments, but there isn’t such evidence for the other fuel loading classes.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", treatment, all_of(load_vars)) |&gt; group_by(class)\n\nd |&gt; nest() |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    levene = car::leveneTest(load ~ factor(treatment), data)[[3]][1],\n    welch_uneq_var = oneway.test(load ~ treatment, data)$p.value,\n    welch_eq_var = oneway.test(\n      load ~ treatment, var.equal = TRUE, data = data\n    )$p.value,\n  ) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Levene tests suggest that variances are unequal across treatments for all fuel loading classes.

These p-values provide evidence that for onehr fuels, the mean value of ha is greater than gs and ld, and the mean value for hd is also greater than gs and ld. Also, for vegetation, gs is greater than ha only. While this test is robust to the assumptions of normality, some of our data is highly skewed. Also, because of the nesting of our data, observations are not independent, so our effective sample size is not what is assumed by this test.\n\n\nCode\ngh_test &lt;- d |&gt; rstatix::games_howell_test(load ~ treatment) |&gt;\n  filter(p.adj.signif != \"ns\") |&gt;\n  rstatix::add_y_position(scales = \"free\", step.increase = 0.5)\n\nggpubr::ggboxplot(d, x = \"treatment\", y = \"load\", facet.by = \"class\") +\n  facet_wrap(~class, scales = \"free\") +\n  ggpubr::stat_pvalue_manual(gh_test, label = \"p.adj\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.1)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: pair-wise tests using Games-Howell, for unequal variances across groups. This shows many statistically significant differences, but the assumption of independence, which is likely to have a significant effect on our effective sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Multi-level model\nWe have transects nested within plot corners, corners nested within plots, and plots nested within sites. We would like to detect a treatment effect, while accounting for the non-independence of this nested data structure. The following model, I believe, captures this grouping structure.\n\n\nCode\nform &lt;- load ~ treatment + (1 | site/treatment/corner)\n\n\nThis will estimate a group-wise intercept adjustments for each site, plot, and corner, based on modeled variances for each of these grouping levels.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", site, treatment, corner, all_of(load_vars)) |&gt; \n  group_by(class)\n\nm1 &lt;- d |&gt; nest() |&gt; rowwise() |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    mod = list(lme4::lmer(form, data = data)),\n    emmeans = list(emmeans::emmeans(mod, \"treatment\")),\n    pairs = list(as_tibble(pairs(emmeans, infer = TRUE)))\n  )\n\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\n\nPairwise comparisons with Tukey adjustment for each of 6 multilevel models representing different fuel loading classes reveals that the only evidence for differences in means among treatments is with vegetation between the gs and ha treatments. Another sizeable difference in means is between gs and ha for the onehr fuels (Figure 6.2).\n\n\nCode\nselect(m1, pairs) |&gt; unnest(pairs) |&gt;\n  filter(p.value &lt;= 0.05) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(digits = 3)\n\n\nAdding missing grouping variables: `class`\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Pairwise comparisons among treatments with p-values &lt; 0.05 for 6 multilevel models.

The problem, explained here is two fold. For GLMMs and unbalanced experimental designs, the null distribution for the F-statistic may not be F-distributed.\nFor us, we have a balanced design (I think) and so the F-statistic should be F distributed and degrees of freedom should be clear from the details of the design. Because of our balanced design, the Kenward-Rogers approach and “inner-outer” design approach (which is used by nlme::lme) give the same result of 9 DF for all of the pairwise tests.\nUsing the package pbkrtest we can get parametric bootstrap liklihood ratio statistics and test this statistic in a number of different ways. The PBtest should probably be the most reliable, but I’ve included descriptions of the others from the package documentation for reference. I’m also including an F-test in which degrees of freedom are estimated with Kenward-Rogers approach.\n\nLRT\n\nAssuming that LRT has a chi-square distribution.\n\nPBtest\n\nThe fraction of simulated LRT-values that are larger or equal to the observed LRT value.\n\nBartlett\n\nA Bartlett correction is of LRT is calculated from the mean of the simulated LRT-values\n\nGamma\n\nThe reference distribution of LRT is assumed to be a gamma distribution with mean and variance determined as the sample mean and sample variance of the simulated LRT-values.\n\nF\n\nThe LRT divided by the number of degrees of freedom is assumed to be F-distributed, where the denominator degrees of freedom are determined by matching the first moment of the reference distribution.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", all_of(c(transectid, load_vars)))\ndd &lt;- ungroup(d) |&gt; split(~class)\n\n\nif(file.exists(\"pmod.rda\")) {\n  load(\"pmod.rda\")\n} else {\n  cluster &lt;- parallel::makeCluster(rep(\"localhost\", parallel::detectCores()))\n\n  pmod &lt;- imap(dd, function(d, i) {\n    form &lt;- load ~ treatment + (1 | site/treatment/corner)\n    amod &lt;- lme4::lmer(form, d, REML = FALSE)\n    nmod &lt;- update(amod, . ~ . -treatment)\n    krtest &lt;- pbkrtest::KRmodcomp(amod, nmod) |&gt;\n      pluck(\"test\", \\(x) slice(x, 1)) |&gt;\n      rename(df = ndf) |&gt;\n      rownames_to_column(\"test\")\n    pbkrtest::PBmodcomp(amod, nmod, cl = cluster) |&gt;\n      pluck(summary, \"test\") |&gt;\n      rownames_to_column(\"test\") |&gt;\n      bind_rows(krtest) |&gt;\n      mutate(class = i, .before = 1) |&gt;\n      relocate(c(df, ddf, F.scaling), .after = stat)\n  }) |&gt; \n    list_rbind() |&gt;\n    filter(test %in% c(\"LRT\", \"PBtest\"))\n \n  parallel::stopCluster(cluster)\n  save(pmod, file = \"pmod.rda\")\n}\n\npmod |&gt; knitr::kable(digits = c(NA, NA, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4))\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Liklihood ratio tests and parametric boot strap tests of model significance: whether the model with treatment, fits the data better than the intercept only model (adjusting for nesting structure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass\ntest\nstat\ndf\nddf\nF.scaling\np.value\n\n\n\n\nonehr\nLRT\n7.48\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.0580\n\n\nonehr\nPBtest\n7.48\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.1678\n\n\ntenhr\nLRT\n0.77\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.8576\n\n\ntenhr\nPBtest\n0.77\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.9018\n\n\nhundhr\nLRT\n0.70\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.8725\n\n\nhundhr\nPBtest\n0.70\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.9101\n\n\ndufflitter\nLRT\n6.05\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.1093\n\n\ndufflitter\nPBtest\n6.05\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.1109\n\n\nthoushr\nLRT\n0.22\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.9739\n\n\nthoushr\nPBtest\n0.22\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.9657\n\n\nveg\nLRT\n11.70\n3\nNA\nNA\n0.0085\n\n\nveg\nPBtest\n11.70\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.0340\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Model checking\nTaking a look at residual vs. fitted and qqplots of the model, it looks like our residuals are not normally distributed and there is not constant variance.\n\n\nCode\n# These are functions to plot for each model, residuals vs fitted and normal\n# quantiles.

Fit using lme4 The residuals are not homogenous.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll try to control the variance by refitting the model with nlme::lme and using the weights argument. I’ll be using the pearson residuals which are corrected for heteroscedasticity.\nI had to use the control argument sigma = 1 for the model to fit. I’m not sure why, I read it in the documentation for nlme::varConstProp. I’m modeling variance as a constant proportion of the fitted values of the model. This seems to have cleaned up the variance, but the the model for 1,000-hr fuels is causing a “singular matrix” error. Perhaps this is because of the excess of zeros?\nAdditionaly, residuals are still not normally distributed.\n\n\nCode\nmod2 &lt;- d |&gt;\n  filter(class != \"thoushr\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    mod = list(nlme::lme(\n      fixed = load ~ treatment,\n      random = ~ 1 | site/treatment/corner,\n      data = data,\n      weights = nlme::varConstProp(),\n      control = nlme::lmeControl(sigma = 1)\n    )),\n    fitted = list(fitted(mod)),\n    resid = list(resid(mod, type = \"pearson\")),\n    .keep = \"unused\"\n  )\n\npatchwork::wrap_plots(resid_qq_plot(mod2), ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Same as Figure 6.3 but variance is modeled as a function fitted values, assuming a linear relationship.

This means that when I specify my random effect using the nesting notation: 1 | site/treatment/corner, I’m estimating a variance for corner:treatment:site, treatment:site, and site. The interaction of treatment and site here is analagous to a plot effect, of which there are 16.",

Ten, hundred and thousand-hour fuels were statistically, very similar across treatments (p = 0.7 — p = 1).

The LD treatment also had about 1.7 times more 10-hr fuels that the HD treatment (5.4 vs. 3 Mg ha-1, p = 0.001). Hundred-hour fuels were also greatest in the GS treatment, with an average of about 19 Mg ha-1, which was about 2.6 times greater than in the HD treatment (7 Mg ha-1, p &lt; 0.001). Thousand-hour fuels were greatest in the HD treatment, with 80 Mg ha-1, which was about 2.7 times greater than the LD and HD treatments (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Fuel loading for live vegetation was similar across treatments at around 2.5 Mg ha-1.

    "text": "6.3 Bayesian mode\nIt has been difficult fitting these models zeros, non-constant variance, and non-normal response. A more flexible approach may be to implement my models in a Bayesian context. This has the added benefits of ease of interpretability of the results and quantified estimates of uncertainty.\nI’ll use brms with the same formula I used for the lmm above. First we’ll reload our data.\nAll the data is nested to facilitate modeling each fuel class separately. We’ll look at the average loading to get an idea of the data.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", all_of(c(transectid, load_vars))) |&gt;\n  group_by(class) |&gt; nest() |&gt; rowwise()\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Gaussian model\nI started out using a Gaussian model for load, with mostly default priors on the random effects. This was for convenience more than for anything. A model with positive support only, and more approriate priors would improve the model. This parameterization also results in the first treatment level (gs) being interpreted as the global intercept. This implies the unfortunate assumption that the other levels entail more variability as their priors result from the combination of the intercept prior as well as the treatment prior, wheres the prior for the first level only contains the variability in the intercept. Thus, parameterizing the model by removing the intercept for the main effect would allow equivalent interpretations of all four treatment levels. I use this approach below in the Gamma model.\n\n6.3.1.1 Priors\nWe are using mostly uninformative priors for our un-pooled (fixed effect) estimates of treatment intercepts. They are all set as normal distributions, centered at the median of the fuel load with a sd of 2.5 times the sd of the data. While it is not possible to have negative values here, a current limitation of the brms package is that you can’t put bounds on individual coefficients, and we would not want to contstrain our treatment effects to be positive, as they are centered around the mean and will be both positive and negative.\n\n\nCode\n# add calcualted priors to the data\n\nd &lt;- mutate(d, \n  priors = list(\n    brms::set_prior(\n      str_glue(\n        \"normal( {round(median(data$load))}, {round(2.5 * sd(data$load))} )\"\n      ), \n      # lb = 0, \n      class = \"b\", coef = \"Intercept\"\n    ) +\n    brms::set_prior(\n      str_glue(\n        \"normal( 0, {round(1.5 * sd(data$load))} )\"\n      ), \n      class = \"b\"\n    )\n    # brms::set_prior(\"student_t(3, 0, 2.5)\",  lb = 0, class = \"sd\")\n  )\n)\n\n# Plot the priors\nd |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    prior_dist = list(tidybayes::parse_dist(priors) |&gt; \n    rename(dist_class = class))\n  ) |&gt;\n  unnest(prior_dist) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(ydist = .dist_obj, color = interaction(coef, dist_class))) +\n    stat_slab(normalize = \"panels\", fill = NA) +\n    stat_pointinterval(position = position_dodge(width = 0.3, preserve = \"single\")) +\n    geom_text(\n      aes(label = format(.dist_obj), y = mean(.dist_obj), x = 0.97, vjust = 0),\n      position = position_dodge(width = 0.3), show.legend = FALSE\n    ) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    facet_wrap(~ class, scales = \"free_x\") +\n    scale_color_hue(name = \"prior\", labels = c(\"treatment\", \"intercept\", \"sd\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Normal priors for the intercept are centered at the median and sd of 2.5 times the sd of the data. For the fixed effect treatment, they are centered at zero with the a standard deviation equal to 1.5 sd of the data.

It also dramatically overpredicts negative values (which are absent from our data, despite the fact that the density smoothing of the observed values seems to suggest there are some.)\nThe fact that the model predicts negative values suggests that it is not right for our data, and could potentially be biasing comparissons between treatments. A Gamma distribution for the response makes more sense.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Gamma model\nThe gamma model has support for only postive values, which makes sense for our weight per area data. Initial data exploration also revealed that the gamma appears to be a good fit for our data. This makes sense, as our data is fundamentally transformed count data, and the gamma distribution is the continuous generalization of the negative binomial, which is used for modeling count data.\n\n6.3.2.1 Formula\nI’m assuming the outcome is hurdle gamma distributed.\n\\[\n\\operatorname{HurdleGamma}(y \\mid \\mu, \\text{shape}, \\text{hu}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{hu}\n  &\\quad\\text{if } y = 0, \\text{ and}\\\\\n(1 - \\text{hu}) \\operatorname{Gamma}(y \\mid \\alpha, \\beta)\n  &\\quad\\text{if } y &gt; 0,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\), and \\(\\text{shape} = \\beta\\). This is a mixture model where the proportion of zeros are estimated and the rest of the observations are assumed to be gamma distributed. Because the gamma distribution doesn’t incldue support for zero, we don’t have to worry about any “overlapping” zero predictions from the gamma portion of the model.\nOur model form is as follows:\n\\[  \n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\operatorname{HurdleGamma}(\\mu, \\text{shape}, \\text{hu})\\\\\n\\log(\\mu_i) &= \\bar{\\alpha} +\n  U_{\\text{site}[i]}\\sigma_{u} +\n  V_{\\text{plot}[i]}\\sigma_{v} +\n  W_{\\text{corner}[i]}\\sigma_{w} +\n  \\beta_{treatment[i]}\\\\\n\\bar{\\alpha} &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(M, S)\\\\\nU_j &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1) \\qquad \\text{for } j=1 \\dots 4\\\\\nV_j &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1) \\qquad \\text{for } j=1 \\dots 16\\\\\nW_j &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1) \\qquad \\text{for } j=1 \\dots 64\\\\\n\\sigma_u &\\sim \\operatorname{normal^+}(0, 1)\\\\\n\\sigma_v &\\sim \\operatorname{normal^+}(0, 1)\\\\\n\\sigma_w &\\sim \\operatorname{normal^+}(0, 1)\\\\\n\\beta_j &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1) \\qquad \\text{for } j=1 \\dots 4\\\\\n\\text{shape} &\\sim \\operatorname{Gamma}(0.01, 0.01)\\\\\n\\text{hu} &\\sim \\operatorname{beta}(1, 1)\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nHere is an interpretation for each line of the above model.\n\nObservations of transects are assumed to be hurdle gamma distributed given the fixed and random intercept, grouping structure.\nThe log fuel loading for a transect is a function of the grand mean plus random effects for site, plot, and corner, and fixed effect of treatment. Each \\(U\\), \\(V\\), and \\(W\\), is accompanied by a \\(\\sigma\\) parameter. This is the non-centered parameterization and is equivalent to just defining a distribution with a scale of \\(\\sigma\\), but factoring out the scale parameter leads to better numerical stability in the Markov-chain Monte Carlos algorithm.\nThe prior for bar-a, the grand mean, is assumed to be normally distributed with mean and SD of \\(M\\) and \\(S\\), repsectively. These are chosen based on the mean and 2.5 times the SD of the data converted to produce a log normal distribution on the log scale. This should be a weakly informative prior.\nEach of the four unique site effects come from a normal distribution centered on zero.\nSame as above for 16 plot\nSame as above for 64 corners.\nThe site effects come from a normal distribution with a SD that is assumed to be from a postive constrained, standard normal distribution. On the response scale, about 95% of the mass of the joint distribution of this line and line 4 (\\(U_j\\sigma_u\\)) is in the interval \\([0.11,8.9]\\), which implies that we would be supprised to see any site with a load more than 9 times any other.\nSame as 7 for plots.\nSame as 7 for corners.\nThe fixed effect of treatment on the log scale is assumed to be from a standard normal distribution. On the response scale, we would be supprised if the effect of any treatment was more than seven times any other.\nThis is the default prior for the shape parameter of the gamma distribution in brms. It is chosen to be minimally informative.\nOur prior assumption about the proportion of zeros is also minimally informative, it is mostly uniform between 0 and 1.\n\nOne problem with these independent prior assumptions is that the multiplicative effect of the terms on the response scale (due to exponentiation) can lead to impossibly large predictiontions, particularly when multiple random or fixed effect parameters are sampled simultaneosly in their upper tails. For instance, if the effects of site, plot, and corner where sampled at 2 (on the log scale) and the effect of treatment, at 1.8, this could lead to a predicted \\(\\mu\\) more than 2,400 times greater than the grand mean.\nA better choice would be to use a joint prior, like the Dirichlet, so a prior could be set on the total variance and the individual component variances would vary (in either a eqaul, or unequally weighted fashioin) in their repsective proportions of that total.\nIn this regard, with either independent, or independet priors, further work could be done on establshing the relative importance of each variance component and setting priors that reflect these differences. For our nesting structure, this means defining the length scale over which fuels are expected to vary most/least, from 10 m to 50 m to &gt; 100 m, to thousands of meters.\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Compute priors\nFirst I’ll set my prior. This is complicated because we are now working with a log link. According to Solomon Kurz, this is how to transform your mean and sd for a normal distribution on the identity scale, to the equivalent normal distribution on the log scale (a lognormal distribution). This is what we’ll use for our prior on the grand mean (\\(\\bar{\\alpha}\\)).\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- load2(\"long\", \"pre\", all_of(c(transectid, load_vars))) |&gt;\n  group_by(class) |&gt; nest() |&gt; rowwise()\n\nlnp &lt;- function(data) {\n  # Desired values\n  m &lt;- mean(data)\n  s &lt;- 2.5 * sd(data)\n  # use the equations\n  mu    &lt;- log(m / sqrt(s^2 / m^2 + 1))\n  sigma &lt;- sqrt(log(s^2 / m^2 + 1))\n  # output mu and sigma on lognormals own scale\n  list(mu = round(mu, 2), sigma = round(sigma, 2))\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# data frame to plot the priors\npd &lt;- d |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    priors = list(brms::set_prior(\n      str_glue(\"normal({mu}, {sigma})\", .envir = lnp(data$load))\n    )),\n    prior_dist = list(tidybayes::parse_dist(priors)),\n    lims = list(\n      tibble(\n        xmin = quantile(exp(prior_dist$.dist_obj), .01),\n        xmax = quantile(exp(prior_dist$.dist_obj), .99)\n      )\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  rename(fuel_class = class)\n\nggplot(data = unnest(pd, prior_dist)) +\n  tidybayes::stat_halfeye(\n    aes(xdist = exp(.dist_obj)),\n    normalize = \"panels\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      label = format(.dist_obj),\n      x = mean(exp(.dist_obj)),\n      y = 0.97,\n      hjust = 0\n    )\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ fuel_class, scales = \"free_x\", labeller = fuel_class_labeller) +\n  coord_cartesian_panels(panel_limits = unnest(select(pd, lims), lims)) +\n  labs(x = expression(exp(bar(alpha))))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Normal priors for the grand mean (global intercept) centered at the median and sd of 2.5 times the sd of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2.3 Prior predictive check\nThe below code ran with very many divergent transitions and the results did not really make sense. This may have to do with a comment I found here: independent priors specified on the log link usually don’t sample.\nAn alternative is refitting the whole model with different priors and comparing the output to infer the prior influence.

The description of the meaning of the priors in the following list should probably be included for explanation.\n\n\n6.4.2 fiting and diagnostics\n\nThe actual code used to fit the model in brms should be included in an appendix.\nFigure 6.9 should be included as an example of the connection between our priors and posterior distributions.\nWe should summarize rhat and tail ess for all models as shown in Table 8.1\n\nR-hat values were all below 1.005\nBulk and tail effective sample sizes were generally above 1000, with the exception of plot and corner SD’s for 1000-hr and Live vegetation fuels, which were above 640.\nThese should be adequate effective sample sizes for robust inference.\n\nFigure 6.10 should be included to show model fit\nTable 6.9 gives an interpretation of R-squared for bayesian models for each of our models.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Results\n\n6.4.3.1 Predicted means\n\nThe posterior effect of treatment is summarized in Figure 6.11.\nFor 1-hr fuels, treatments HD and HA show patterns of higher loading. This may have to do with more fine fuel inputs from higher retention. This could lead to increased fire behavior, which could be of benefit if attempting to burn under marginal conditions.\nThe HD treatment shows the potential for higher loading of duff and litter. This could be due to the same effect as for 1-hr fuels, but the HA treatement does not show a similar trend in this case. This could be explained by a higher probability of sampling near a trees base, where duff and litter load are known to be higher.\nAn obvious trend in live vegetation is revealed in the GS treatment, where tree sprouts and brush was able to regenerate without any competition. The potentially reduced live vegetation in the HA treatment is unexpected.\n\n\n\n6.4.3.2 Predicted contrasts\n\nPairwise comparison of treatment efffect is sumarized in Figure 6.12\nContrasts take into account how expected predictions co-vary and is a better indicato of potential differences between treatments.\nIf we take the 95% credible interval as the measure of “significant differences” between treatments, then the HA treatment would be considered to result in greater fuel load than the GS treatment, and the opposite trend would be true for live vegetation: HA is greater than GS.\nThe posterior distributions of contrasts reveal more potential differences with somewhat reduced certainty for 1-hr, Duff & litter, and Live vegetation.\n\nIt is also likely that the LD treatment has lower 1-hr fuel loading than HA.\nSimilar to the HA treatment, the HD treatment also appears to have greater loading than GS.\nFor Duff & litter, the HD treatment may have greater load than HA\nFor live vegetation, LD may have greater load than HA.\n\nFor 10, 100, and 1000-hr fuels, there is no real detectable differences between treatments.",

This could be due to site or plot effects, or to microsite (within plot) effects, but it is not immediately clear why this diverging performance should be so apparent with redwood and not tanoak.\n\n\nCode\n#|\n#| message: false\n\nspecies_labels &lt;- c(LIDE = \"Tanoak\", SESE = \"Redwood\")\nyear_labels &lt;- c(`1` = \"Year 1\", `5` = \"Year 5\", `10` = \"Year 10\")\nplot_labels &lt;- labeller(\n  spp = species_labels,\n  year =  year_labels\n)\n\n\nsprouts |&gt;\n  lengthen_data(\"ht\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(ht, treat, color = treat, fill = treat)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\") +\n  geom_dots(binwidth = unit(0.019, \"npc\")) +\n  facet_grid(vars(spp), vars(year), scales = \"free_x\", labeller = plot_labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Treatment\") +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", aesthetics = c(\"color\", \"fill\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Raw sprout heights for redwood and tanoak in four different harvest treatments, at three measurement periods over 10 years. Note the difference in x-axis scales.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the raw data collected for ~100 redwood and tanoak sprout clumps in each of four harvest treatments. There is a clear increasing trend with year. The height distribution of redwood is much more dispersed than tanoak. The dispersion of both species increases with year. Redwood are consistently taller.

It also implies a steady decrease in height from 0 to around 400 SDI. The strength of the relationship appears to be increasing over time, particularly for redwood.\n\n\nCode\nsprouts |&gt;\n  lengthen_data(\"ht\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(sdi_init, ht, color = factor(year))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(span = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~spp) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: SDI vs HT for both species, across measurement years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.3 Species/site/plots\nLets see what the variability among sites and plots looks like, I’ll focus on year 10 only.\nFigure 7.4 reveals some differences between sites, particularly for redwoods. Waldo North tends to have larger redwoods and Camp 6 has a large proportion of smaller redwoods.\nFigure 7.5 shows that much of the difference in sites has to do with one outlier plot within a site, and less about general site trends. We should expect plots to capture a portion of the variance. Most notable is the plot level difference between redwood and tanoak. For redwood, the large ammount of within plot variability combined with the between plot variability obscures the treatment (and site) effect. If you squint, there appears to be a similar overall pattern between redwood and tanoak repsonse to treatment, but it appears they respond differentially to certain plots.\n\n\nCode\nsprouts |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(ht10, site, fill = spp)) +\n  stat_slab(aes(thickness = after_stat(pdf * n)), alpha = 0.6, scale = 0.7) +\n  stat_dotsinterval(side = \"bottom\", scale = 0.7, slab_color = NA) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(x = \"year 10 height (m)\", y = NULL, fill = \"species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Distribution of heights at year 10 at each site for two species.

Grouped by treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Height increments\nHeight increments contain similar information as heights, but allow us to compare directly between years.\nFigure 7.6 shows that across treatments and species, height growth slows down in the second period (years 5-10). This is more true for redwood but it starts with more rapid growth than tanoak. In the most crowded treatment (HD), redwoods height increment has become slower than tanoaks in the second period. Also, in the second period, the high density, aggregated treatment appears to have slightly higher (or equal) average growth increment, which is not completely expected.\n\n\nCode\nsprouts |&gt;\n  lengthen_data(\"ht_inc\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      ht_inc,\n      fct_relevel(treat, treat_order),\n      fill = factor(year),\n      color = factor(year)\n    )\n  ) +\n  stat_slab(alpha = 0.5) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.4, preserve = \"single\")\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~spp) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(\n    fill = \"Year\",\n    color = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Treatment\",\n    x = expression(Height~increment~(m~yr^-1))\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = rnd_color_brewer(\"Set2\", c(1,4)),\n    aesthetics = c(\"color\", \"fill\")\n  )\n\n\n[1] 1 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Variations in annual height growth increment between the first and second measurement periods (years 1-5, and 5-10, respectively).",

    "text": "8.2 Modeling\nWe have nested data where we have multiple observations within trees (over time), trees within plots and plots within sites. Any of these levels of nesting might result in correlations between observations, which violates the assumption of independence for OLS models, but can be accounted for using multi-level models.\nI may want to include a categorical variable (spp) as a random slope (on the LHS of the random parts) to allow random effects to be estimated for each species separately. Michael Clark explores this scenario, with some simpler data.\nMy approach will be to start with a simple model and build towards more complex models.\n\n8.2.1 Height increment\nBy starting with height increment modeling, I will be able to answer question 1 in the objectives. This conclusion may be helpful for informing total height modeling. I am curious whether height in the first 10 years increases linearly with age. Is there a growth slow down in year 5-10 compared to years 1-5?\nWe saw in Figure 7.6 that increment does slow down somewhat in the second measurement period (year 5-10), at least for redwoods, but we may be justified in overlooking this. Lets look at individual tree’s height trajectories.\n\n\nCode\ndht &lt;- lengthen_data(sprouts, \"ht\")\n\ndht |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, ht, color = spp, group = tree)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~treat * site) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Data plot showing trajectory of individual tree heights across the three measurements. Height increase appears fairly linear with year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, it looks like height increases linearly with year. Lets test this with a model.\n\nht_inc ~ year\nIgnoring everything else, there is a 0.08 m / yr slow down in the second period.\nht_inc ~ year + spp + year:spp\nThat slow down has more to do with redwood than tanoak.\nht_inc ~ year + spp + treat + year:spp + year:treat + spp:treat + year:spp:treat\nThere are overall treatment effect on growth which varies by species (redwood is more affected) but there are no more significant interactions with year. Our data does not detect significant differences in slow down by treatment or species. j\nht_inc ~ year + spp + treat\nThis includes only additive effects and the effect of year is the same as model 1.\nht_inc ~ year + spp + treat + spp:treat\nAgain, the species by treatment interactions seem to be significant.\nht_inc ~ year + spp + treat + spp:treat + year:spp\nThe species year interaction remains important.\nht_inc ~ year + spp + treat + spp:treat + year:spp + year:treat\nAgain, the treatment by year interactions do not seem important/estimable.\nht_inc ~ treat + year + spp + treat:spp + spp:year + (1 | plot) + (1 | tree)\nNow I introduce random intercepts for plot and tree. These lead to much smaller AIC’s.\nht_inc ~ treat + year + spp + (1 | plot) + (1 | tree) + treat:spp + year:spp + treat:year\nBut treatment by year is still (mostly) not significant.\nht_inc ~ treat + year + spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot) + treat:spp + year:spp\nAdding a random slope for species by plot results in another big jump in AIC, but also reduces confidence in the treatment*species interaction. It would seem that the potential differences in species by treatment growth rate are obscured by redwoods greater variability across plots.\nht_inc ~ treat + year + spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot) + year:spp\nRemoving the treat * species interaction results in a solid AIC boost.\nht_inc ~ treat + year * spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot)\nSwitching to glmmTMB and adding a dispersion model that includes a three-way interaction reduces AIC, and results in more well-behaved residuals.\n\nThe coefficients are different for the glmmTMB model because it includes a model for dispersion. Here the dispersion model estimates are ommitted.\nModel 12 has the lowest AIC and the residuals are relatively well behaved.\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_suxpr3a30h0gkv0thgnr\n    \n    \n

selected model, based on AIC and examination of residuals had the form:\n\n\n[1] \"ht_inc ~ treat + year * spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot)\"\n\n\nThe model selected based on AIC lacks a treatment x species interaction, suggesting that there is not evidence that treatments affected species differentially. It also lacks a treatment x year interaction. This means that there was not enough evidence to support that treatment was related to changes in growth rate.\nThe presence of treatment in the model (0.001 ≤ p &lt; 0.03) suggests that the levels of treatment were associated with different growth rates across species and years. And the species x year interaction (p &lt; 0.001) suggests changes in growth rates are different for redwood and tanoak.\nAveraging over growth periods, treatment specific height increments for redwood ranged from 0.66 to 0.86 m yr-1, and for tanoak, from 0.29 to 0.49, with the slowest growth in the HD treatment and the fastest in the GS treatment. height increment was greater in the GS treatment than the HA and HD treatments by about 0.19 m yr-1 (p &lt; 0.001). The LD treatment was intermediate, but not statistically distinguishable from the other treatments (0.13 &lt; p &lt; 0.28).\n\n\nCode\nemm_treat &lt;- emmeans(minc[[12]], \"treat\", by = \"spp\")\nplot(emm_treat, comparisons = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Estimated marginal means for the effect of harvest treatment on redwood and tanoak sprout height increment, averaged over two growth periods, ten years after harvest. Purple bars represent confidence intervals and statistical significance (α = 0.05) is indicated by non-overlaping red arrows.\n\n\n\n\n\nRedwood growth slowed from 0.80 to 0.67 m yr-1 in the second period and tanoak slowed from 0.39 to 0.34 m yr-1.\nRedwood grew faster than tanoak, but slowed down more relative to it in the second period. Height increment for redwood was 0.42 m yr-1 greater in the first period and 0.33 m yr-1 greater in the second period than tanoak height increment.\n\n\nCode\nemmeans(minc[[12]], c(\"year\"), by = \"spp\") |&gt; plot(comparisons = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Estimated marginal means for the effect of growth period on redwood and tanoak sprout height increment, averaged over four harvest treatments, ten years after harvest.

effects\nThe best model according to AIC includes a random intercept for plot and a random slope for spp. Because spp is a factor, this effectively estimates a species specific intercept, but also takes into account the covariance of the species plot effect.\n\n\n8.2.5.2 Fixed effects\nThe best model for dispersion included speceis and treatment, but no interactions. This suggests that treatments do not affect species differentially.\nBecause the best model did not contain a species x treatment interaction, comparisons between treatments is the same for both species. The GS treatment resulted in greater heights in year 10 than the other treatments (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.04). Predicted mean height for redwood ranged from 10.29 m in the GS treatment to 6.16 m in the HD treatment. For tanoak, predicted mean height ranged from 5.12 in the GS treatment to 3.04 in the HD treatment. Predicted mean heights followed the pattern GS &gt; LD &gt; HA &gt; HD.\n\n\nCode\ndht10 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(treat, ht, color = spp, fill = spp)) +\n  facet_grid(~spp, switch = \"x\") +\n  theme(panel.spacing = unit(0, \"lines\"),\n        strip.background = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_blank(),\n        ) +\n  geom_dots() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", aesthetics = c(\"color\", \"fill\")) +\n  geom_pointrange(\n    data = emmcomp,\n    aes(y = the.emmean, ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),\n    color = \"gray60\",\n    position = position_nudge(x = -0.07),\n    size = 0.7,\n    linewidth = 2.3,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = emmcomp,\n    aes(y = the.emmean, xend = treat, yend = rcmpl),\n    color = \"blue4\",\n    lineend = \"butt\",\n    linejoin = \"bevel\",\n    arrow = arrow(length = grid::unit(2.5, \"mm\")),\n    position = position_nudge(x = -0.07),\n    linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = emmcomp,\n    aes(y = the.emmean, xend = treat, yend = lcmpl),\n    color = \"blue4\",\n    lineend = \"butt\",\n    linejoin = \"bevel\",\n    arrow = arrow(length = grid::unit(2.5, \"mm\")),\n    position = position_nudge(x = -0.07),\n    linewidth = 1\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_segment()`).\nRemoved 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_segment()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Predicted mean height and 95% confidence intervals (gray bars) for redwood and tanoak stump sprouts 10 years after harvest using four different harvest treatments.

This term (and it’s interactions) can than be interpreted as a modeled growth increment, and although we only have observations at years 1, 5, and 10, other years predictions will be linearly interpolated.\nThe following models were fit, and are summarized in Table 8.1.\n\nOLS linear model including year in a 3-way interaction.\nEliminate the 3-way interaction (spp:treat:year), keeping others. This results in a significantly lower AIC.\nFirst random-effects model including interactions and universal random slopes for site and plot, and time-series.\nAllow the random effects to (co-) vary by species.\nSame as 5, but attempt to remove the 3-way interaction again.\nSame as 6, but attempt to simplify the random effects by forcing them to be estimated independently, correlation between species is not estimated.\nRe-introduce the 3-way interaction again.\nOmit the random effect for site. This is supported by the interpretation of\n\n\n\nLike 9, but try simplified (independent) random effects.\n\nOne problem with this is that I’m comparing AIC for different random effects using ML, when I should be using REML. This may be a problem throughout my model selection.\n\ndht &lt;- lengthen_data(sprouts, \"ht\")\n\nmht2 &lt;- lm(ht ~ treat * spp * year, data = dht)\n\nmht3 &lt;- lm(ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:year + spp:year + treat:spp, data = dht)\n\nmht4 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (1 | site) + (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nmht5 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (0 + spp | site) + (0 + spp | plot) + \n    (0 + spp | tree),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nmht6 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + year:spp + treat:year +\n    (0 + spp | site) + (0 + spp | plot) + (0 + spp | tree),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nmht7 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + year:spp + treat:year + (1 | site:spp) +\n    (1 | plot:spp) + (1 | tree:spp),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nmht8 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (1 | site:spp) + (1 | plot:spp) + (1 | tree:spp),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nmht9 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (0 + spp | plot) + (0 + spp | tree),\n  data = dht\n)\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nmht10 &lt;- lmer(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (1 | plot:spp) + (1 | tree:spp),\n  data = dht\n)\n\n# I tried fitting year as a factor, but then could not fit a model that included\n# the 3-way interaction and random slopes for species.

for small trees (year 1) and (b) variance is not constant. Finally, we are fitting year as a linear effect because fitting it as a factor with 3 levels led to model convergence problems, but ideally, we would like to allow different relationships between height and year, because, as we saw in the previous section, height growth is not constant in the first 10 years.\nFor these reasons it makes sense to try another modeling framework, particularly, a gamma distributed model, with a modeled dispersion parameter. It allows only positive predictions, can right skewed distributions, and the dispersion can be modeled as a function of covariates.\n\nmht11 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat * spp * year + (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  data = dht, family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht12 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year + (1 | plot) + \n  (1 | tree),\n  data = dht, family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht13 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year + \n  (0 + spp | plot) + (0 + spp | tree),\n  data = dht, family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nWarning in finalizeTMB(TMBStruc, obj, fit, h, data.tmb.old): failed to invert\nHessian from numDeriv::jacobian(), falling back to internal vcov estimate\n\nmht14 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year +\n  (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  data = mutate(dht, year = factor(year)), family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht15 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year +\n  (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  dispformula = ~ year,\n  data = mutate(dht, year = factor(year)), family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht16 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year +\n  (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  dispformula = ~ year * spp,\n  data = mutate(dht, year = factor(year)),\n  family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht17 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:spp + treat:year + spp:year +\n  (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  dispformula = ~ year * spp + treat + treat:spp,\n  data = mutate(dht, year = factor(year)), family = Gamma(link = \"log\")\n)\n\nmht18 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  ht ~ treat + spp + year + treat:year + spp:year +\n  (1 | plot) + (1 | tree),\n  dispformula = ~ year + spp + treat + treat:spp,\n  data = mutate(dht, year = factor(year)),\n  family = gaussian(link = \"log\")\n)\n\ndo_model_summary_table &lt;- function(model_list) {\n  modelsummary(\n    model_list,\n    output = \"markdown\",\n    shape = term:component + statistic ~ model,\n    metrics = c(\"AIC\", \"BIC\", \"RMSE\"),\n    estimator = \"ML\",\n    gof_omit = \"F|Log.Lik\",\n    stars = TRUE\n  )\n}\n\ndo_model_summary_table(list(\n    \"Model 11\" = mht11, \"Model 12\" = mht12, \"Model 13\" = mht13,\n    \"Model 14\" = mht14, \"Model 15\" = mht15, \"Model 16\" = mht16,\n    \"Model 17\" = mht17, \"Model 18\" = mht18\n))\n\n\n\nTable 8.2: Summary table for models 2-10, described above.

    "text": "12.1 Douglas-fir counts\nFor Douglas-fir in particular, we are interested in the counts of stems more than the basal area. This, requires another model. A counts model.\nHeres the raw counts. There doesn’t appear to be any treatment differences in the number of Douglas-fir seedlings per plot.\n\n\nCode\nregen_df &lt;- regen |&gt;\n  count(site, treat, plot, spp) |&gt;\n  complete(nesting(site, treat, plot), spp, fill = list(n = 0)) |&gt;\n  filter(spp == \"df\")\n\nregen_df |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(treat, n * per_ha[\"corner\"])) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Treatment\", y = expression(Stems%.%ha^-1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Summary of raw count data for Douglas-fir expressed in stems per hectare, for Douglas-fir seedlings in four harvest treatments 10 years after harvest.\n\n\n\n\n\nA negative binomial model seems to fit acceptably when modeling raw counts (not TPH). I was not able to achive model convergence with the specification of zero inflation or dispersion formulae.\n\n\nCode\nm1 &lt;- glmmTMB(\n  n ~ treat + (1 | site/treat),\n  regen_df,\n  family = nbinom1()\n)\n\nres1 &lt;- simulateResiduals(m1)\nplot(res1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no statistically detectable differences\n\n\nCode\nemmeans(m1, \"treat\")\n\n\n treat emmean    SE  df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL\n gs     0.704 0.416 Inf    -0.111      1.52\n ld     0.509 0.433 Inf    -0.340      1.36\n ha     0.608 0.434 Inf    -0.242      1.46\n hd     0.983 0.390 Inf     0.219      1.75\n\nResults are given on the log (not the response) scale. \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\nThe model for Douglas-fir seedling counts does not result in any statistically significant differences between treatments. Generally, we expect about six seedlings per 4-meter-radius plot, or 1,000 to 1,400 seedling per hectare.\n\n\nCode\nemmeans(m1, \"treat\") |&gt;\n  contrast(\"pairwise\") |&gt;\n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  tinytable::tt()\n\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: P-values for pairwise contrasts of Douglas-fir seedling counts in in four different harvest treatments 10 years after harvest.\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_cfiyub4q8o0o0cqe3dsw\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                contrast\n                estimate\n                SE\n                df\n                z.ratio\n                p.value\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  gs - ld\n                   0.19546011\n                  0.4004914\n                  Inf\n                   0.4880507\n                  0.9617809\n                \n                \n                  gs - ha\n                   0.09613691\n                  0.4132590\n                  Inf\n                   0.2326311\n                  0.9955689\n                \n                \n                  gs - hd\n                  -0.27803131\n                  0.3680676\n                  Inf\n                  -0.7553812\n                  0.8743937\n                \n                \n                  ld - ha\n                  -0.09932320\n                  0.4261828\n                  Inf\n                  -0.2330531\n                  0.9955450\n                \n                \n                  ld - hd\n                  -0.47349142\n                  0.3842515\n                  Inf\n                  -1.2322436\n                  0.6062714\n                \n                \n                  ha - hd\n                  -0.37416822\n                  0.3949796\n                  Inf\n                  -0.9473103\n                  0.7792439\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave data from this page for future use\n\n\nCode\nsave(regen, spp_col, per_ha, for_const, file = \"regen_visualize.rda\")",
