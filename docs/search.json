    "text": "Abstract\nForest managers practicing retention forestry in the west need data on regeneration dynamics and hazardous fuels to design structures that are productive and fire resilient. This analysis of the 10-year re-measure of the redwood multi-aged experiment in the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in Mendocino County, California, explores the regeneration response of several species following different harvesting techniques including group selection (GS), high-density aggregated retention (HA), and high/low density dispersed retention (HD; LD). We measured size and growth of 10-year old redwood and tanoak stump sprout regeneration, the density of all tree species, and surface fuels 10 years after partial harvests.\nRedwood regeneration responded strongly and positively to increasing openness (10.1 m2 ha-1 in GS vs 0.9 m2 ha-1 in HD). Tanoak basal area response was comparatively modest and was lowest in the HA treatment (2.2 m2 ha-1 in GS vs 1.3 m2 ha-1 in HA). The difference between redwood and tanoak sprout basal area decreased quickly with increasing canopy cover and tanoak basal area was slightly greater than that of redwood in the HD treatment. Douglas-fir seedling counts were consistent across treatments with an average expectation of 413 seedlings per hectare.\nRedwood grew faster and achieved greater heights than tanoak across all treatments and growth periods. But redwood height growth slowed more than tanoak in years 5-10 compared to years 1-5 (0.8 m yr-1 -&gt; 0.67 m yr-1 for redwood, vs. 0.39 m yr-1 -&gt; 0.34 m yr-1 for tanoak). The mean height of redwood sprouts at Year 10 ranged from 10.64 m in the GS treatment to 6.3 m in the HD treatment. For tanoak, predicted mean height ranged from 5.2 m (GS) to 3.08 m (HD).\nFuel loading generally showed few statistically significant differences between treatments. Vegetative fuel loading was highest in the GS treatment and nearly 3 times that of the HA treatment which was lowest. One-hour fuels were highest in the HA treatment and around double that of the GS treatment.\nThe PCT dramatically reduced live surface fuels and increased fine dead surface fuels including 10- and 100-hour fuels, leading to greater stratification of treatments in terms of dead fuels.\nHarvesting techniques designed to promote productivity (like GS, LD) resulted in significantly greater redwood growth and height. However, these same techniques also produced higher levels of live vegetation fuels pre-PCT and, consequently, higher volumes of fine dead fuels (10-hr and 100-hr) immediately following the PCT fuels treatment.",

    "text": "1.1 Multiaged management\nEcological forestry which maintains a wide range of ecosystem services while also supplying timber requires a diverse landscape of highly varied forest structures (Aplet, 1994; Nolet et al., 2018; O’Hara, 2001) . These, in turn, require a variety of silvicultural techniques to implement and sustain (O’Hara, 1998; Schütz, 2002). The development of multiaged stand structures has long been of interest to silviculturists as a key alternative to the conceptually and logistically simpler, even-aged management (Schütz, 1999). Multiaged silviculture refers to the retention of trees of distinctively different age classes, growing together within the same stand. These cohorts may co-occur at the tree level, or in small, even-aged patches within the stand. In the latter case, the distinction between even- and multiaged management can become blurred with increasing patch size, but patches are generally much smaller (often less than 1 ha) than the stands they compose. The pursuit of multiaged stand structures has often met with mixed results (O’Hara, 2002) and this has led to the investigation of several different systems for achieving such structures. Research into the efficacy and results associated with these is ongoing (Beese et al., 2019; Nolet et al., 2018). One such system that has gained popularity in recent decades is known as the retention system, which allows for the retention of a range of tree densities, in dispersed or aggregated spatial patterns and can be used to maintain multiaged stands, or transform from even-aged management (S. J. Mitchell & Beese, 2002).\nRedwood forests offer a prime opportunity for multiaged management because coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) regenerate reliably via stump sprouting and are relatively shade tolerant. The very high leaf areas observed in these forests, suggest their suitability for a multi-layered forest structure (Berrill & O’Hara, 2007; Van Pelt et al., 2016). Additionally, with their high timber value and productivity, redwood forests are of keen interest to private timber producers. Despite redwood’s fitness for multiaged stand structures, the successful development of subordinate cohorts depends on adequate access to light, and light deficiency can lead to reduced vigor and mortality in young sprouts and understory trees (Barrett, 1988; Muma et al., 2022; O’Hara et al., 2007; Webb et al., 2012).\nComplicating redwood regeneration and sprout development is the fact that the competing hardwood species, tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), is also shade tolerant and a vigorous resprouter. Tanoak is a keystone species in terms of wildlife habitat and First Nation’s cultural identities, but from a timber production standpoint it is often perceived as a nuisance due to a lack of market development combined with its widespread proliferation following intensive, repeated conifer harvesting (Bowcutt, 2011). While redwood grows more quickly than tanoak in multiaged stands, competition from hardwoods such as tanoak reduce conifer growth and drought resistance (Berrill et al., 2021; Dagley et al., 2023). Meanwhile, there has been little scientific investigation into the development of tanaok under shade (Waring & O’Hara, 2008; Wilkinson et al., 1997).",

    "section": "1.2 Management effects on sprouting",
    "text": "1.2 Management effects on sprouting\n\n1.2.1 Measures and general patterns of sprout development over time\nTree sprouting response following cutting is commonly characterized by presence (percent stumps sprouting), abundance (sprout density), and size (height and diameter). Interpretation of these metrics depends on the time between treatment and measurement, as early sprout growth is largely driven by mobilization of carbohydrates stored in the parent stem and root system (Del Tredici, 2001). As a result, differences associated with external conditions may not be evident early in development. Redwood sprout clumps may consist of more than 100 stems in the first year after cutting (Neal, 1967), but rapidly self-thin, particularly under high light conditions (Boe, 1975). Under overstory competition, self-thinning may proceed more rapidly and can result in mortality of entire sprout clumps (O’Hara & Berrill, 2010). In contrast to eastern hardwoods, where self-thinning typically occurs over decades (Gould et al., 2007), this process may extend for centuries in long-lived redwoods (O’Hara et al., 2017).\nBecause percent sprouting, sprout density, and sprout size represent distinct aspects of sprouting response, they vary with species, site characteristics, overstory density, parent stump size or age, and geographic context. Even when these factors are considered, substantial unexplained variation among sites may remain (Keyser & Loftis, 2015; Nieves et al., 2022).\n\n\n1.2.2 Factors influencing initial sprout response\nAcross many sprouting species, the proportion of stumps that sprout following cutting often declines with increasing tree size or age, although this pattern varies by species and site conditions (Johnson, 1977; Nieves et al., 2022). In redwoods, evidence for declining percent sprouting with increasing size or age is mixed (Barrette, 1966; Lindquist, 1979; Neal, 1967; Wiant & Powers, 1967), potentially reflecting the wide range of tree sizes and ages present in these forests. Some studies suggest that percent sprouting may increase with age to a threshold and decline in trees older than approximately 200–400 years (O’Hara et al., 2007; Powers & Wiant, 1970).\nAfter cutting, 90–100% of second-growth redwoods (&lt; 90 cm dbh) typically sprout (Barrette, 1966; Lindquist, 1979), whereas sprouting among larger, older redwoods may approach 50% (Boe, 1975; Neal, 1967). Declining sprouting with increasing size has also been documented in tanoak and other coastal hardwoods (Harrington et al., 1992).\nResidual overstory density may influence percent sprouting in some species and regions, but evidence for this effect is inconsistent and sensitive to study design (Nieves et al., 2022). In redwood forests, this effect is generally weak or absent (Barrett, 1988; Lindquist, 1979). The number of sprouts produced per stump is also typically unrelated to overstory density (Atwood et al., 2009; Knapp et al., 2017), and is assumed to follow a similar pattern in redwood forests (Lindquist, 1979; O’Hara & Berrill, 2010).\n\n\n1.2.3 Internal and external factors influencing sprout development over time\nOver time, sprout growth and survival are strongly influenced by competitive conditions. Among sprouting species, sprout growth generally increases with understory light availability (Gardiner & Helmig, 1997; Keyser & Zarnoch, 2014; Knapp et al., 2017), although the influence of light is weakest early in development, when growth is dominated by stored carbohydrates (Gardiner & Helmig, 1997; Keyser & Loftis, 2015). Despite its shade tolerance, redwood requires a minimum light threshold to sustain sprout growth (O’Hara & Berrill, 2010).\nSprout growth is also positively related to stump diameter, with larger stumps producing faster-growing sprouts, a pattern observed in redwood (Berrill et al., 2018), tanoak (Harrington et al., 1992), and eastern hardwoods (Dey et al., 1996; Keyser & Loftis, 2015). Survival of sprouts in subsequent years depends on overstory density and competitive pressure, particularly as stands approach canopy closure. Entire sprout clumps may experience rapid mortality under low-light conditions (O’Hara & Berrill, 2010). Longer-term sprout persistence has also been shown to vary with site and regional factors (Keyser & Loftis, 2015; Nieves et al., 2022), although these influences have not been well quantified in redwood forests.\nDue to rapid early growth, sprouting species can influence the composition of regenerating stands (Del Tredici, 2001), sometimes favoring less desirable species (Keyser & Zarnoch, 2014). In redwood ecosystems, redwood sprouts typically outgrow tanoak stump sprouts during the first five years following partial harvest (Muma et al., 2022), though the longer-term implications of these dynamics for stand development remain uncertain (Berrill et al., 2018). Additional disturbance interactions, including herbivory and wildlife damage, may further influence sprout development and species composition (Berrill et al., 2017; Dagley et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2023; Wilkinson et al., 1997).",

    "title": "1  Introduction",
    "section": "1.3 Forest fuels",
    "text": "1.3 Forest fuels\nThroughout many of the fire-adapted forests of California, fire exclusion combined with timber harvest has led to dense, suppressed stands, proliferation of more fire-sensitive species, and an accumulation of surface fuels (Safford & Stevens, 2017; Stephens et al., 2009). This situation combined with climate change has led to increased size and frequency of high-severity fires in many regions (Parks & Abatzoglou, 2020; Westerling, 2016), prompting widespread interest in fuel treatments and silvicultural interventions creating resilient stand structures.\nThis interest has seen less momentum in the redwood region, likely due to the perceived safety of these typically moist forests from the threat of large wildfires. Yet redwood litter is among the most flammable of conifer litter types (Fonda et al., 1998), seasonal drought leads to cured fuels, especially during extended breaks in coastal fog (Jacobs et al., 1985), and numerous physiological adaptations suggest that redwood has evolved under fire disturbance pressure (Varner & Jules, 2017). More concretely, there have been at least six large fires in redwood ecosystems since 2003, burning at least 189,000 ha including widespread areas of canopy loss. Scientific consensus places the pre-colonization fire return interval for redwood forests at 6-25 years across their range (Lorimer et al., 2009). It is assumed that much of this activity is attributable to indigenous burning (Varner & Jules, 2017).\nConsistently low foliar moisture content levels have been recorded for tanaok (Kuljian & Varner, 2010) and the foliage has been compared to that of other sclerophyllous species such as those found in chaparral ecosystems which are characterized by intense, stand replacing fires suggesting high flammability, particularly with low canopy base heights (Fryer, 2008; McDonald, 1981). And tanoak leaf litter is among the most flammable of western hardwoods and has been compared to that of fire adapted conifers (Varner et al., 2017). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the flammability of live tanoak foliage or tanoak sprouts.\nThere have been several studies that have quantified various fuel strata in redwood forests. Kittredge (1940) did so for duff and litter in a redwood plantation. Greenlee (1983) studied fuels at Big Basin State Park. Stuart (1985) reported on fuels at Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Finney and Martin (1993a, 1993b) reported on fuels in second-growth redwood forests (aged ~100 years) at Annadel and Humboldt Redwoods State Parks. Graham (2009) reported on fuels in old-growth stands across redwood’s range. Glebocki (2015) studied fuels with and without thinning treatments in young (&lt; 50 years) redwood/Douglas-fir stands. No fuel studies, to my knowledge, have been conducted in redwood forests actively managed with multiaged silviculture, but fuel dynamics represent a potentially important decision variable to consider when managing forest stands that may be subjected to intentional or unintentional fire.\n\n1.3.1 Management effects on fuels\nDepending on the method used, thinning and harvest treatments may increase, or not affect surface fuel loading. Whole tree removal results in the least fuel accumulation but can be more expensive than other options (Han & Han, 2020). Most other treatment methods increase surface fuels (Agee & Skinner, 2005; Stephens et al., 2009). The magnitude of this increase is variable, reflecting factors such as treatment mode, intensity, and pre-existing conditions (Schwilk et al., 2009). Additional research is needed to clarify the effects of these factors on short-term (Hood et al., 2020; Schwilk et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2009) and long-term changes to surface fuel load resulting from specific management actions (Hood et al., 2020; Stephens et al., 2012).\nThe majority of fine dead fuels (&lt; 8 cm) generated by treatment activities typically decompose within 10 years (Burton et al., 2022; Hood et al., 2020; Martinson & Omi, 2013; O’Hara et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2012). But live woody fuels, which respond vigorously to increased growing space, often persist or increase over time (Keyes & Varner, 2006). The nature of this response depends on eco-type and the amount of growing space liberated by the treatment, which in turn can become occupied by herbaceous plants (Vilà-Vilardell et al., 2023), shrubs (Odland et al., 2021), or small trees (Hood et al., 2020).\nOvertime, duff and litter loads are frequently lower in more open stands than stands with a more closed canopy. This may result from increased decomposition rates due to greater insolation and increased throughfall, or reduced deposition rates resulting from fewer canopy fuels (Hood et al., 2020; Keane, 2008).\nMost fuel reduction thinning research focuses on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the United States, with additional studies from other Mediterranean and semi-arid regions (Burton et al., 2022; Schwilk et al., 2009; Vilà-Vilardell et al., 2023). Far fewer studies have been conducted in coastal forests (Norman et al., 2009), but see Wilder et al. (2025).",

    "text": "1.4 Pyrosilviculture\nForest management for timber and other objectives and prescribed and wild fire are inherently interlinked. This requires research which considers these historically disjunct realms of research in a wholistic way. Fire informed and fire dependent silviculture has been a hallmark of traditional forest stewardship practices for indigenous across northern California since time immemorial (Anderson, 2013). Fire informed silviculture has also been practiced and researched in the Southeastern U.S. for around 100 years (R. J. Mitchell et al., 2009). The American west has been slower to embrace this paradigm shift in thinking now termed “pyrosilviculture” (North et al., 2021). It is my hope that this thesis serves as an example of bridging the gap between the art and science of growing trees to support multiple uses and the thinning and burning practices typically regarded as “fuels management” activities (York et al., 2021). The ability to envision these realms of understanding as integral and essential pieces of a common forest stewardship will lead to new insights and increase our capacity for better land management.\nTherefore, the objective of this research was to quantify the development of live surface fuels–the forest understory–as well as dead surface fuels by size class and their dynamics with regard to a PCT fuels treatment with potential to reduce fire severity. And to measure these within the context of a multiaged silvicultural system under a range of residual overstory densities to explore trade offs between overstory retention, new sprout development, and surface fuel management.",

The mission of the JDSF is to remain in timber production for research and demonstration purposes. The predominant cover type is redwood, tanoak, and Douglas-fir forest at elevations ranging from 20 m near the coast to 700 m inland. The climate is Mediterranean with cool, wet winters and an average annual precipitation of about 1150 mm. The sites that compose our experiment were all redwood dominated with significant components of tanoak and Douglas-fir and were well stocked with trees 80 to 100 years old. All of our study sites are between 13 and 16 km from the Pacific Ocean at elevations between 130 and 300 m, on well-drained, sandstone-derived soils. The sites are located on various aspects on mid to upper-slope positions (Figure 2.1), and the site quality is classified as Site Class II (Lindquist & Palley, 1963; Webb et al., 2012).",

    "section": "2.2 Study design",
    "text": "2.2 Study design\nIn 2012, four treatments were replicated at four different sites. The treatments were: group selection (GS), high-density dispersed retention (HD), high-density aggregated retention (HA), and low-density dispersed retention (LD). The GS treatment is composed of a circular 1-ha opening in which all trees were removed, surrounded by a 50-meter buffer of light thinning in which less than 1/3 of the basal area was removed. The remaining treatments were applied over 2-hectare treatment units. The target post-harvest density was specified in terms of relative density using an assumed upper stand density index (SDI) limit for redwood of 2,470 stems ha-1 (Reineke, 1933). The target residual relative density for the HA and HD treatments was 21% (SDI = 520), and the for the LD treatment it was 13% (SDI = 320). These densities were chosen to balance the objectives of stand volume production and individual tree growth assuming a subsequent, similar harvest after 20 years (Berrill & O’Hara, 2009).\nAfter harvesting, a single 0.2-hectare square macro plot was established in the center of each treatment unit. Approximately 25 redwood and 25 tanoak sprout clumps that were well distributed across the plot, were selected for measurement. Additionally, for redwood, sprout clumps were selected evenly from those with, and without residual standing trees.\nTen years after the initial harvest, regeneration plots and fuel transects were established within the macro plot (Figure 2.2). Circular regeneration plots with a 4-meter radius were established 10 meters from each macro plot corner, towards the plot center. Terminating at the center of each of these regeneration plots, 10-meter fuel transects were established parallel to the macro plot edges. Live fuels were estimated in 1-meter radius “sampling cylinders” at the five-, and nine-meter locations along each transect.\nFollowing year 10 measurements, all plots received a PCT treatment where the objective was to release merchantable conifers such as redwood and Douglas-fir from competition. Competing trees and shrubs were cut, lopped, and scattered within the measurement plots and fuel transects were re-measured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A diagram of the fuel sampling design depicting a 0.2-hectare macro plot (black outline), fuels transects (black lines), sampling cylinders (orange circles) where duff, litter, and live and dead vegetation were measured, and vegetation sub-plots (green circles), where regeneration density and diversity were quantified.",

    "section": "2.3 Data collection",
    "text": "2.3 Data collection\n\n2.3.1 Regeneration\nTen years after the initial harvest, four four-meter-radius regeneration plots were established within each macro plot (Figure 2.2). All regenerating trees (sprouts and seedlings) within the plot were recorded. Regenerating trees less than 5 cm diameter at breast height (1.4 m) were tallied by 2.5 cm size classes and the actual DBH of all other regenerating trees were recorded. This allowed for an estimation of sprout and seedling density by species.\n\n\n2.3.2 Sprout size\nSprout height data were collected during the winter at years 1, 5, and 10 following the initial harvest. Sprout heights at each period were based on the tallest individual within the selected redwood and tanoak clumps at the time of measurement with a height pole placed at the same location on the ground at each measurement period. The observer eliminated parallax by observing from a location up-slope, level with the height of the sprout. Sprout DBH for only redwood was collected in year 10.\n\n\n2.3.3 Fuels\nAlso at 10 years after the initial harvest, fuel transects were established and sampled according to the FIREMON protocol (Lutes et al., 2006), with some adaptations that were unique to this project. This protocol is very similar to that of Brown (1974). One-, 10-, 100-hr, and 1000-hr (or coarse woody) fuels were those less than 0.635 cm, 0.635 to 2.54 cm, 2.54 to 7.62 cm and those 7.62 cm and greater, respectively and included only dead and downed woody fuels (not those attached to live vegetation, or standing dead). Transect lengths for 1-, 10-, and 100-hr fuels were two, two, and four meters, respectively during pre-PCT measurements. During post-PCT measurement, the length of the 1-hr fuel transect was reduced to one meter because of the dramatic increase in these fuels. Coarse woody fuels were measured along the entire 10-meter transect.\nRedwoods, like other species in Cupressaceae, shed branchlets instead of individual leaves. This leads to difficulty in distinguishing “litter” from 1-hr fuels. We chose to use an estimated cutoff of about 2 mm for redwood branchlets, where larger pieces were considered 1-hr fuel and smaller pieces were considered part of the litter layer. We did not distinguish between “leafy” and “awl like” leaf shapes (Graham, 2009).\nLive vegetation percent cover and average height were estimated in 1-meter-radius “sampling cylinders” as described in the FIREMON protocol (Lutes et al., 2006). A notable exception is that the sampling cylinders were allowed to extend to the (average) top height of the live fuels that were continuous within less than a meter of the ground. This resulted in average live vegetation heights that could sometimes reach near the height of the sprouts and average heights above two meters were estimated with the help of a clinometer. This decision makes explicit instances when when fuels are vertically continuous with the ground. Live vegetation percent cover was estimated for four vegetation classes: live woody fuels, dead woody fuels, live herbaceous fuels, and dead herbaceous fuels. Dead “live” fuels includes dead fuels attached to live plants, or those still rooted in the ground. Particles in these conditions are not counted as downed woody fuels when tallying fine and coarse woody fuels along fuel transects. These fuels are, though, expected to behave differently during combustion than live “live” fuels. Average vegetation height was recorded for two classes: the average height of all woody fuels and the average height of all herbaceous fuels. These estimates pertain to the particles present in the sampling cylinder, and not the area-average, thus a cylinder with only one percent cover, could still have an average height of two meters, i.e., the empty space within the cylinder does not affect the average height. The average height and percent-cover estimates are visual estimations and efforts were made to compare these frequently to ensure that estimates among observers were consistent. Percent cover estimates were discrete, rounded to the nearest class in the set: 0.5, 3, 10, and all subsequent 10 percent increments up to 100 percent.\nThe depth of duff and litter was measured at one representative location within each of the two, 1-meter-radius sampling cylinders along each transect. When duff and litter conditions varied greatly in a single sampling cylinder, a location was chosen to represent the average of conditions within the cylinder.\nFuel bed depth was estimated as the average height of the fine and coarse woody debris components within each sampling cylinder. Theoretically, this included litter, but not duff. This estimate was not described in the FIREMON protocol, but it was designed to be made in a similar manner as described for vegetation heights.",

    "section": "2.4 Analysis",
    "text": "2.4 Analysis\nAn analysis was conducted in three stages, one for each of the three response categories: fuels, sprout size, and regeneration density. All analyses were conducted using R and attempts were made to document all data, decisions, and techniques within a Quarto notebook, which is published at https://fisher-j.github.io/multi-age. All response variables were analyzed using multi-level models to account for the inherent nesting structure of the data, including multiple measurements of sprouts over time, where applicable. Grouping levels were included in the models if their variance estimate was determined to be significant. If including a grouping level resulted in a meaningful change in estimates or confidence intervals, the grouping level was kept. Because the overall objective was to detect differences between treatments, treatment was used as the primary independent variable. Model development and selection were carried out using Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and visualization of (probability integral) transformed residuals (Hartig, 2022). Models were built using the R package GLMMtmb, which provides a consistent framework for exploring different response distributions and link functions as well as the ability to model variance as a function of predictors (Brooks et al., 2017). The final model structures chosen for each response are given in the results section.\nModels were interpreted using estimated marginal means calculated with the R packages marginaleffects and emmeans (Arel-Bundock et al., 2024; Lenth, 2021). Predictions incorporating the effects of all model components were made on the response scale for a grid of predictors consisting of all unique combinations of factors in the data that were used in at least one component of a given model (we didn’t have numeric predictors) except in the case of tree heights where predictions were made for each observation in the data set. Standard errors for the predictions were calculated using the delta method. Predictions were averaged across non-focal predictors (especially “random” effects) to obtain the population estimates of marginal means. These means are expected to be applicable to other treatments when conducted across equal proportions of sites with conditions similar to those used in our study. Notably, our population estimates assume equal proportions of north and south facing aspects.\n\n2.4.1 Regeneration\nSprout count data from our 4-meter-radius regeneration plots were converted to basal area per acre per species. Tallies of species by size class for sprouts less than 5 cm dbh were converted to diameters using the class midpoint (1.27 or 3.81 cm) before calculating basal area per acre. Minor species (i.e., those other than redwood, tanoak, and Douglas-fir) were combined into an “other” category. Missing species on a plot were made explicit by assigning a value of 0 m2 ha-1 for that species and plot. In addition to basal area, Douglas-fir stem counts (stems ha-1) were modeled separately.\n\n\n2.4.2 Sprout heights\nTwo metrics were analyzed from the sprout height data: height increment (m year-1), and total height (m) at year 10. For height increment, there were two measurements for each tree: increment for years 1 to 5 and increment for years 5 to 10. Thus, analysis of these data included tree as a candidate random effect. While not making a difference for analysis results, it is worth noting that these data were structured differently from the other datasets in that plot was made a globally unique identifier, thus making explicit the nesting of plots within sites or treatments and eliminating the need to specify this nesting structure in the R code model formulas.\n\n\n2.4.3 Fuels\nFuel load in Mg ha-1 was estimated for 1-hr, 10-hr, 100-hr, combined duff and litter (“duff/litter”), 1,000-hr, and live vegetation fuels at the transect level. Any transect where a fuel type was not observed was assigned a value of zero for that class and transect. Fuel load for 1- through 1,000-hr fuels were calculated using the method in Brown (1974). The required size-class specific parameters (specific gravity, particle inclination, and average diameter) were derived from a previous study where I used parameters averaged across all of the measured plots (Glebocki, 2015). For 1,000-hr fuels, decay classes 1-3 were considered “sound” and decay classes 4 and 5 were considered “rotten” for the purpose of calculating load and these loads were combined. Duff and litter were measured at two locations along each transect and these were averaged at the transect level. We did not measure the bulk density of duff and litter fuels, but based on findings in other studies in the redwood region, we opted to combine these classes into a single fuel class, using an average bulk density found across those studies of 7.73 Mg ha-1 (Finney & Martin, 1993; Kittredge, 1940; Stuart, 1985). Vegetation fuel load was calculated using bulk density constants of 8 Mg ha-1 m-1 for herbaceous fuels and 18 Mg ha-1 m-1 for woody components (Gangi, 2006). Live and dead components were combined to calculate herbaceous and woody loading. Herbaceous and woody fuel loads were then combined and averaged at the transect level (two measurements per transect) to determine total vegetation loading.\n\n\n\n\nArel-Bundock, V., Greifer, N., & Heiss, A.

The GS treatment had the greatest basal area of redwood regeneration at 10.12 m2 ha-1, which was 9.28 m2 ha-1 greater than in the HD treatment (p = 0.19). The LD and HD treatments were intermediate.\nTanoak regeneration basal area was intermediate between that of redwood and Douglas-fir and other species. The GS and LD treatments had similar responses, as did the HA and HD treatments. The GS treatment resulted in 2.24 m2 ha-1 of tanoak basal area, which was 1.33 m2 ha-1 greater than in the HA treatment (p = 0.18).\nOn average, for Douglas-fir, we expect about 0.17 m2 ha-1 of basal area across treatments. The greatest basal area of Douglas-fir was in the GS treatment which was 0.12 m2 ha-1 greater than in the HA treatment (p = 0.76). The LD, HA, and HD treatments were all comparatively similar.\nOther species included grand fir, madrone, and California wax-myrtle, of which there was a total of 23, 28, and 16 observations across our 16 macro plots (comprising 64 tree density plots). Generally, each plot had between 0 and 9 observations of other species, except for one macro plot with the LD treatment, which had 16 observations (data not shown).\nAccording to predictions made from this model for other species, there was not enough evidence to confirm a statistically significant difference between treatments. On average, we expect about 0.11 m2 ha-1 of basal area across treatments. The greatest basal area of other species was in the HD treatment which was 0.12 m2 ha-1 greater than in the HA treatment (p = 0.26). The GS and LD treatments were intermediate.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Grand means (m2 ha-1) for basal area of regeneration of each species across treatments 10 years after the initiation of a multiaged redwood forest.

This shows that we expect on average, 7.88 m2 ha-1 greater redwood basal area than tanoak basal area in the GS treatment (p = 0.1), about 1.69 m2 ha-1 in the LD treatment (p = 0.4), and about 0.6 m2 ha-1 in the HA treatment (p = 0.48). In the HD treatment, we expect to see slightly higher tanoak basal area (p = 0.55).\nUncertainty in average redwood basal area across sites, indicated by the size of 95% confidence intervals, is much greater than that of tanoak in the GS treatment, but this difference diminishes such that GS &gt; LD &gt; HA &gt; HD (Figure 3.2). In the HD treatment redwood and tanoak average basal area uncertainty across sites is very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Basal area (m2 ha-1) modeled at the vegetation plot level for four harvest treatments and two species classes (n = 16).

This specifies a general (unstructured) covariance matrix that allows the random effect variance to differ by species (heteroscedasticity) and allows for non-zero correlations between species-level effects within the same plot (e.g., assessing if plots that are favorable for one species are also favorable for others). This variance-covariance matrix takes the following form, where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) represent different species.\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{macro}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_A^2 & \\rho_{AB}\\sigma_A\\sigma_B & \\rho_{AC}\\sigma_A\\sigma_C \\\\\n\\rho_{AB}\\sigma_A\\sigma_B & \\sigma_B^2 & \\rho_{BC}\\sigma_B\\sigma_C \\\\\n\\rho_{AC}\\sigma_A\\sigma_C & \\rho_{BC}\\sigma_B\\sigma_C & \\sigma_C^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n3.2.1 Height increment\nThe selected height increment model used a normal response distribution on the identity link. It included treatment, growth period, species, and the interaction of species and growth period as fixed effects. A random intercept was included for tree (multiple observations) and macro-plot, and another random effect allowed the response to vary by species differently for each macro plot. The dispersion parameter for the response was modeled (with a log link) as a function of treatment, growth period, species and all three-way interactions (Listing 3.3).\n\n\n\nListing 3.3\n\n\n\n\nFamily: gaussian (identity) \nConditional: ht_inc ~ treat + year * spp + (1 | tree) + (0 + spp | plot)  \nDispersion: ~spp * year * treat (log) \n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nY_i \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_i = \\beta_0^{\\mu} + \\beta_{\\text{trt}}^{\\mu} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i + \\beta_{\\text{year}}^{\\mu}\n\\cdot \\text{Year}_i + \\beta_{\\text{spp}}^{\\mu} \\cdot \\text{Spp}_i +\n\\beta_{\\text{spp:year}}^{\\mu}(\\text{Spp}_i \\times \\text{Year}_i) +\n\\alpha_{\\text{tree}[i]} + \\alpha_{\\text{macro}[i],\\text{spp}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\sigma_i) = \\beta^{\\sigma}_0 + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{yr}}\n\\cdot \\text{Year}_i + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{spp}} \\cdot \\text{Spp}_i + \\dots + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{3way}}\n(\\text{Trt}_i \\times \\text{Year}_i \\times \\text{Spp}_i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{\\text{tree}} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\text{tree}})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{\\text{macro}, \\text{spp}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_{\\text{macro}_1, \\text{spp}_1} \\\\\n\\alpha_{\\text{macro}_1, \\text{spp}_2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_{\\text{macro}_j, \\text{spp}_k} \\end{pmatrix} \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mathbf{0},\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{macro}})\n\\]\n\n\\(Y_i\\): Height increment (m yr-1) for sprout observation \\(i\\).\n\\(\\mu_i\\): Mean height increment for observation \\(i\\).\n\\(\\sigma^2_i\\): Variance of height increment for observation \\(i\\).\n\\(\\alpha^{\\mu}_{\\text{tree}}\\): Random intercept for tree.\n\\(\\alpha^{\\mu}_{\\text{macro}, \\text{spp}}\\): Random effect for species, co-varying within macro plot.\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{macro}}\\): Unstructured variance-covariance matrix for species within macro plot.\n\nThe model selected based on AIC lacks a treatment x species interaction, suggesting that there is not evidence that treatments affected species differentially. It also lacks a treatment x year interaction. This means that there was not enough evidence to support that treatment was related to changes in growth rate.\nThe inclusion of treatment factors in the model (0.001 ≤ p &lt; 0.03) indicated that the levels of treatment were associated with different growth rates across species and years. And the species x year interaction (p &lt; 0.001) suggested that changes in growth rates were different for redwood and tanoak (Figure 3.4).\nFor tanoak, height increment was greatest in the GS treatment at 0.48 m yr-1. This was about 0.17 m yr-1 more than in the HA and HD treatments, which were very similar at about 0.3 m yr-1.\nRedwood followed a similar pattern but with more pronounced differences between treatments. Height increment for redwood in the GS treatment was 0.96 m yr-1, which was about 0.4 m yr-1 greater than in the HD treatment (p = 0). Additionally, there was evidence that the GS treatment led to greater height increment than the LD treatment by about 0.17 m yr-1 (p = 0). And the LD treatment was higher than the HA treatment by about 0.15 m yr-1 (p = 0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Estimated marginal means for the effect of harvest treatment on redwood and tanoak sprout height increment, averaged over two growth periods, ten years after harvest.

The best model included species and treatment, but no interactions in the fixed effects. This suggests that treatments do not affect species differentially in terms of the mean response (height at year 10). It also included a model for dispersion (log link) with predictors species, treatment, and their interaction (Listing 3.4).\n\n\n\nListing 3.4\n\n\n\n\nFamily: gaussian (log) \nConditional: ht ~ treat + spp + (0 + spp | plot)  \nDispersion: ~spp * treat (log) \n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nY_i \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0^{\\mu} + \\beta_{\\text{trt}}^{\\mu} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i + \\beta_{\\text{spp}}^{\\mu} \\cdot \\text{Spp}_i + \\alpha_{\\text{spp}[i], \\text{macro}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\sigma_i) = \\beta^{\\sigma}_0 + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot\n\\text{Trt}_i + \\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{spp}} \\cdot \\text{Spp}_i +\n\\beta^{\\sigma}_{\\text{trt:spp}}(\\text{Trt}_i \\times \\text{Spp}_i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{\\text{spp}, \\text{macro}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_{\\text{spp}_1,\n\\text{macro}_1} \\\\ \\alpha_{\\text{spp}_1, \\text{macro}_2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_{\\text{spp}_j, \\text{macro}_k} \\end{pmatrix} \\sim\n\\operatorname{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{spp}, \\text{macro}})\n\\]\n\n\\(Y_i\\): Height at year 10 for tree \\(i\\).\n\\(\\mu_i\\): Mean height at year 10 for tree \\(i\\).\n\\(\\sigma^2_i\\): Variance of height at year 10 for tree \\(i\\).\n\\(\\alpha_{\\text{macro}, \\text{spp}}\\): Random effect for species, co-varying within macro plot.\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{macro}, \\text{spp}}\\): Unstructured variance-covariance matrix for species within macro plot.\n\nBecause the best model did not contain a species x treatment interaction for the mean response, treatment comparisons were parallel between species. The GS treatment resulted in greater heights in year 10 than the other treatments (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.05). Predicted mean height for redwood ranged from 10.64 m in the GS treatment to 6.3 m in the HD treatment. For tanoak, predicted mean height ranged from 5.2 m in the GS treatment to 3.08 m in the HD treatment.

    "text": "3.3 Fuels\nGamma distributed, linear multi-level models, with a log link were used to model fuel load response (Mg ha-1) for all fuel classes. Random intercepts were specified for three levels of nesting, representing sites, macro plots, and transect corners. A hurdle component with logit link was used for predicting zeros in all models except for the duff & litter model. Dispersion components were included where needed, based on AIC model selection. Models were fit separately for pre- and post-PCT fuel measurements. Duff and litter were not measured post-PCT, and vegetation difference was only modeled post-PCT.\n\n\n\nListing 3.5\n\n\nfamily: Gamma(link = \"log\")\nconditional: fuel_load ~ treatment + (1 | site/macro/corner)\n\n\n\n\\[\nY_i \\sim \\text{hurdle\\_gamma}(\\pi_i, \\mu_i, \\phi_i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\mu_i) = \\beta^{\\mu}_0 + \\beta^{\\mu}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i +\n\\alpha_{\\text{site}[i]} + \\alpha_{\\text{macro}[i]} + \\alpha_{\\text{corner}[i]}\n\\]\nAny model component not explicitly defined below was modeled with only an intercept:\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_i^\\cdot) = \\beta^{(\\pi,\\cdot)}_0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\phi_i^{\\cdot}) = \\beta^{(\\phi,\\cdot)}_0\n\\]\n\n\\(Y_i\\): Fuel load (Mg ha-1) for transect \\(i\\).\n\\(\\pi_i\\): Probability that \\(Y_i &gt; 0\\), the hurdle component.\n\\(\\mu_i\\): Mean of positive values.\n\\(\\phi_i\\): Dispersion parameter for Gamma distribution.\n\\(\\alpha_{\\cdot}\\): Random intercepts for site, macro plot, and corner.\n\\(\\beta^{\\cdot}_{\\cdot}\\): Fixed effects for intercepts and treatment levels for mean, hurdle, and dispersion components .\n\n\n3.3.1 Pre-pct\nFor the Duff & Litter model, there was no hurdle component because there were no zeros in the data, and the dispersion parameter was modeled with only an intercept (see below).\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_i^{\\text{dufflitter}}) = \\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{dufflitter})}_0\n\\]\nFor the 10-hr fuel model, the hurdle and the dispersion components were modeled as functions of treatment.\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_i^{\\text{10hr}}) = \\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{10hr})}_0 +\n\\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{10hr})}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(\\phi_i^{\\text{10hr}}) = \\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{10hr})}_0 +\n\\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{10hr})}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i\n\\] .\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.9: Dispersion and hurdle component specifications for six fuel classes before pct.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                class\n                Dispersion (log)\n                Hurdle (logit)\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  Duff & Litter\n                  ~1\n                  ~0\n                \n                \n                  1-hr\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  10-hr\n                  ~trt\n                  ~trt\n                \n                \n                  100-hr\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  1,000-hr\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  Vegetation\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Duff & Litter, the largest difference was between the HD and HA treatments. The HD treatment had about 54.4 Mg ha-1, and was about 14.39 Mg ha-1 greater than the HA treatment (p = 0.09). Generally, all treatments were similar, with estimated loading of around 47 Mg ha-1.\nOne-hour fuels were highest in the HA treatment, with an expected value of 1.2 Mg ha-1, which was about Mg ha-1 greater than in the GS treatment (p = 0.03). One-hour fuels in the LD and HD treatments were intermediate but the LD was more similar to the GS and the HD was more similar to the HA treatment.\nTen, hundred and thousand-hour fuels were statistically, very similar across treatments (p ≥ 0.7). Treatment averages had maximum differences of around 1, 3, and 10 Mg ha-1 for ten, hundred, and thousand-hour fuels, respectively.\nVegetative fuel loading was greatest in the GS treatment, with an expected value of 29.94 Mg ha-1, which was about\n18.95 Mg ha-1 greater than in the HA treatment (p = 0.05) and LD and HD treatments were intermediate.

Model selection resulted in somewhat more complex models for dispersion (\\(\\phi\\)) and hurdle (\\(\\pi\\)) components. For 1-hr fuels the dispersion component included treatment and site predictors:\n\\[\n\\log(\\phi_i^{\\text{1hr}}) = \\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{1hr})}_0 +\n\\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{1hr})}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i +\n\\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{1hr})}_{\\text{site}} \\cdot \\text{Site}_i\n\\] ,\nand for 100-hr fuels, the dispersion and hurdle components included treatment and site predictors:\n\\[\n\\log(\\phi_i^{\\text{100hr}}) = \\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{100hr})}_0 +\n\\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{100hr})}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i +\n\\beta^{(\\phi,\\text{100hr})}_{\\text{site}} \\cdot \\text{Site}_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_i^{\\text{100hr}}) = \\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{100hr})}_0 +\n\\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{100hr})}_{\\text{trt}} \\cdot \\text{Trt}_i +\n\\beta^{(\\pi,\\text{100hr})}_{\\text{site}} \\cdot \\text{Site}_i\n\\] .\nThe dispersion and hurdle components for the rest of the fuel models included only an intercept.\nDispersion models with treatment as the only predictor were included for 1-hr and 100-hr fuel classes. All models included a hurdle portion to model zeros using a logit link. For 100-hr fuels, the hurdle portion included treatment and site as predictors. For the rest, a constant rate of zeros for all observations was used (Table 3.13).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.13: Model specifications for six fuel classes after pct.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                class\n                Dispersion (log)\n                Hurdle (logit)\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  1-hr\n                  ~trt + site\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  10-hr\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  100-hr\n                  ~trt + site\n                  ~trt + site\n                \n                \n                  1,000-hr\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  Vegetation\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n                \n                  Vegetation Difference\n                  ~1\n                  ~1\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike pre-pct fuel loading which differed little among treatments in terms of fine dead surface fuels, the PCT treatment resulted in additional fine dead surface fuels that differed significantly among treatments. Whereas vegetation fuel loading was reduced and differences between treatments were lessened. Unlike pre-commercial thinning resulted in greater stratification of treatments (Figure 3.8). One-hour fuels for most treatments were around 2.5 Mg ha-1, but the HA treatment was lower than these at about 1.38 Mg ha-1 (p &lt;= ).\nThe GS treatment had the greatest 10-hr fuel loading with 9 Mg ha-1, which was greater than the LD, HA, and HD treatments by\n3.5, 5.15, and 5.94 Mg ha-1, respectively ( p = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0). The LD treatment also had about 2.43 Mg ha-1 more 10-hr fuels that the HD treatment (p = 0.03).\nHundred-hour fuels followed a similar trend as the 10-hr fuels. They were greatest in the GS treatment, with an average of about 19.12 Mg ha-1, which was about 11.69 Mg ha-1 greater than the HD treatment (p = 0.03).\nThousand-hour fuels were greatest in the HD treatment, with an average of about r fuel_post_means$thoushr$hd$estimate Mg ha-1, which was about 37.71 Mg ha-1 greater than the LD and HA treatments (p &lt;= 0.14). The GS treatment was intermediate.\nFuel loading for live vegetation was similar across treatments at around 2.3 Mg ha-1.\nThe difference in vegetation loading before and after PCT was greatest in the GS treatment at about 29.6 Mg ha-1, which was greater than the HA and HD treatments by about 18 Mg ha-1 (p = 0.09 and p = 0.05, respectively). The LD treatment was intermediate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Estimated marginal means (black dots) confidence intervals (gray bars) and statistical comparisons (blue arrows) of fuel loading across four treatments for six different fuel-class models.

However these results were not statistically comparable, due to slightly different model structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Estimated marginal means (black dots) and confidence intervals (colored bars) of fuel loading across four treatments and five different fuel classes, before and after PCT.

    "text": "4.1.1 Redwood and tanoak\nBasal area was selected as the metric for quantifying redwood and tanoak abundance because prolific sprout regeneration in both species was undergoing self-thinning. In this context, basal area provided a more informative measure than stem density, as it better captured treatment responses by reflecting the relative contribution of established stems rather than the transient abundance of sprouts.\nOur use of basal area as a response did not distinguish between number of stems and size of stems. There have been numerous metrics used in attempts to assess shade tolerance (Forrester et al., 2014). Our use of basal area (which conflates growth and survival of sprouts) is justified given the assumption that these are expected to be correlated in forests that do not undergo a long harsh winter (Lin et al., 2002).\nIt is important to point out here that the HA and HD “high-density” treatments in this experiment only targeted a residual overstory relative density of 20% (that is 20% of assumed total carrying capacity of the site), and this was selected as an upper limit to support the objective of maintaining conifer growth (Berrill & O’Hara, 2009).\nWe found redwood growth in the understory—in terms of average total basal area of sprouts 10 years after harvest treatment—responded strongly and positively to increasing levels of openness consistent with previous findings that redwood sprout growth is highly sensitive to light availability and overstory density (Berrill et al., 2018; Muma et al., 2022; O’Hara et al., 2007; O’Hara & Berrill, 2010). In contrast, the tanoak response was comparatively modest reflecting its typical habit of forming a sub-canopy layer in these systems (Hunter et al., 1999; O’Hara et al., 2017).\nShade tolerance theory predicts that at a certain overstory density, understory tanoak abundance should exceed that of redwood. The general trends in our results align with this theory, but our standard errors were too high to derive any clear evidence for this threshold.\nAverage redwood sprout basal area 10 years after treatment was much more dramatically affected by overstory density than tanoak. Each step increase in overstory density (GS -&gt; LD -&gt; HA) saw average redwood sprout basal area reduced by around half. Aggregated retention resulted in about 1/3 greater basal area than in the dispersed retention but the p-values for all comparisons were very high (p &gt;= 0.2).\nLittle is understood about tanoak sprout response under shade (Waring & O’Hara, 2008; Wilkinson et al., 1997). This study contributes to that knowledge by describing a range of tanoak sprout development responses with varying overstory density. Our results suggest that tanoak sprout basal area is reduced by about half when moving from open overstory conditions to 20% relative density, however, none of the treatment differences for tanoak were statistically supported.\nIn all treatments, the uncertainty in the average redwood basal area is much greater than that of tanoak. Given that we modeled the total basal area of all species in each vegetation plot, this suggests that variability in redwood understory basal area was much greater than that of tanoak across macro plots and/or sites. The greater relative uncertainty we observed in redwood compared to tanoak may have to do with redwoods greater sensitivity to light conditions. We selected sites with both north and south facing slopes and this may have led to relatively larger differences for redwood growth response compared to tanoak. Additional uncertainty may be due to variable light levels within macro plots.\nIt is interesting to note that basal area comparisons between redwood and tanoak resulted in steadily decreasing differences between these two species as overstory density increases. This is in contrast to findings from this and other studies when the focus is instead on sprout height growth. This perspective of growth response highlights an important question for these forests: what is the role of below-ground competition in determining the relative growth of redwood and tanoak sprouts? This question has been raised in other studies for redwoods (Oliver et al., 1994) and has been found to play an important role in moderating growth beyond what was expected from shade-tolerance alone, particularly with regard to soil quality (Forrester et al., 2014), or size of cut stump as a proxy for size of resprouting root system (Berrill et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.1.2 Douglas-fir counts\nDouglas-fir abundance was modeled using stem counts because the species does not regenerate through sprouting and thus did not exhibit the self-thinning found in the sprouting species. Moreover, stems were relatively few in number and consisted largely of small seedlings, making stem density a more informative metric than basal area for comparing responses across treatments.\nDouglas-fir is a minor species of special interest due to it’s commercial value and ability to compete with redwoods in the first 100 years of stand development (Wensel & Krumland, 1986). We did not detect statistically supported differences between treatments in terms of basal area or stem counts. While our observed recruitment density of Douglas-fir seedlings may be sufficient for the eventual production of a viable cohort in a multiaged system (Schütz and Röhnisch, 2003, as cited in Schütz & Pommerening, 2013), only the LD and GS treatments are likely to maintain overstory densities conducive to Douglas-fir seedling development (Miller & Emmingham, 2001; Schütz & Pommerening, 2013) given the overstory basal areas recorded at the initiation of the experiment (Muma et al., 2022). Rapidly developing redwood and tanoak sprouts will likely further compromise Douglas-fir seedlings competitive ability.\n\n\n4.1.3 Other species\nOur sampling included relatively few minor species and differences across treatments were small. Though none of the treatment differences were statistically supported, the largest difference occurred between the LD and HA treatment where the latter had less basal area of minor species. While this could be due to low numbers of occurrences of minor species and high variability within treatments, this uniqueness of the HA treatment is found in other places throughout our experiment results: such as for tanoak sprout basal area where the greatest treatment difference was between the GS and HA treatments and in the low vegetation response found in the HA treatment for the pre-PCT fuels data. Potential differences in minor species’ abundances is likely only relevant for grand fir, due to its shade tolerance (Webb et al., 2012). Red alder and western hemlock were observed during an earlier iteration of this experiment, but were not detected with our current experimental design (Muma, 2019).",

    "section": "4.2 Sprout height",
    "text": "4.2 Sprout height\nAn important consideration for redwood sprouts in this experiment is that after thinning, a fraction of existing sprouts will be retained. The retained sprouts will generally be the largest and most vigorous. Our measurement of total height of each sprout-clump represents the size of the best/tallest sprout, revealing which treatment produced larger individuals that would eventually be selected for retention.\nWe found that for both redwood and tanoak, height increment and overall height at year 10 were greatest in the GS treatment, followed by LD, HA, and HD treatments. This pattern indicates that greater reductions in overstory density and more understory light lead to more rapid sprout growth.\nThis strong positive relationship between reduced overstory density and sprout height is a consistent and well-documented finding across various species and forest types in the literature: Understory light availability, which is inversely related to overstory density, is a primary driver of stump sprout growth in redwood-mixed-conifer systems (Berrill et al., 2018; Berrill et al., 2021), and in other systems as well (Atwood et al., 2009; Gardiner & Helmig, 1997; Keyser & Zarnoch, 2014; Knapp et al., 2017).\nWe found that redwood grew faster and achieved greater heights than tanoak across all treatments and growth periods. For example, redwood height increment was 0.42 m/yr greater than tanoak in the first period and 0.33 m/yr greater in the second period. Also, redwood height growth response was much stronger in more open conditions, while tanoak’s was comparatively modest.\nThe increased overstory reduction in this experiment successfully maintained redwood sprout growth, compared to a previous study where overstory reduction was not sufficient to maintain redwood sprout growth (O’Hara & Berrill, 2010). Despite substantial reductions in redwood basal area with our high-overstory-retention treatments, especially compared to tanoak, redwood height growth was still dominant at about 0.6 m yr-1. While the aggregated high-density treatment saw marginally higher sprout height development than the HD treatment, the difference was not large or statistically significant. The initial harvest in both high-density treatments in this experiment resulted in about 39 m2 ha-1. This suggests that the level of overstory harvest prescribed by a previous growth modeling study (32-38 m2 ha-1, Berrill & O’Hara, 2009) may be an upper bound in these systems if redwood sprout growth is to be maintained until the next partial harvest.",

    "section": "4.3 Fuel loading",
    "text": "4.3 Fuel loading\n\n4.3.1 Pre-PCT\nPrior to PCT, surface fuel loading was comparable to other studies in redwood systems. Our treatment level averages for duff and litter ranged from 40 to 55 Mg ha-1 in plots that had post-harvest basal areas (in 2012) of 0 to 40 m2 ha-1. This was comparable to total duff and litter loading found in 120-year-old redwood stands (range: 29 to 55 Mg ha-1) as well as old-growth stands (average: 50 Mg ha-1) and our raw average duff and litter depth of 6.2 cm (data not shown) was similar to that found in a range of redwood stand structures (Finney & Martin, 1993a; Glebocki, 2015; Stuart, 1985). We opted to combine duff and litter into a single metric following previous studies that found similar bulk densities for duff and litter and that separating the two resulted in little difference in average bulk density, given the wide variability found in duff and litter depths Finney & Martin (1993a).\nOur average total fine woody fuel loading, including one-, ten-, and one hundred-hour-fuels (15 Mg ha-1) was within the range found in 120-year-old stands (9 to 20 Mg ha-1, Finney & Martin (1993b)), double that found in very young, mixed stands (7 Mg ha-1, Glebocki (2015)), and 3 Mg ha-1 higher than that found in old growth stands (12 Mg ha-1, Stuart (1985)).\nWhen comparing the average fuel loadings found in this study to those found in the “old growth” and “very young, mixed” stands referenced above, our one-hr fuel loading which, which averaged about 1 Mg ha-1 was similar to that found in the old-growth stand. However it was about half that found in the very young, mixed stand, possibly due to differing stand structures and species compositions. That young forest was dominated by young Douglas-fir and would be expected to have different forest floor characteristics and this notion is supported by our finding of similar 1-hr fuel loading as in the old growth study. Another source of possible error is differences in sampling method for 1-hr fuels. We established a cutoff where redwood particles smaller than roughly 2 mm were considered as litter, rather than 1-hr fuels. If we had counted every redwood leaf-spray, regardless of size, we would have likely found higher 1-hr fuel loads.\nOur average 10-hr fuel loading was higher than in the very young, mixed stand (3.4 vs. 2 Mg ha-1) but similar to the old growth stand. It might be reasonable here to suspect that the smaller trees in the very young, mixed stand did not supply as much 10-hr fuels because of the sizes of their branches, whereas branch shedding patterns in the 10-hr time lags class were more similar between our stands and the old growth ones.\nOur average 100-hr fuel loading of about 11 Mg ha-1 was higher than in both the old growth stands (5 Mg ha-1) and the very young, mixed stands (3 Mg ha-1). This was likely the result of residual fuels (mainly cut tanoak) left over from the harvest treatment that initiated our experiment which would have been absent from the other sites referenced here. In the very young, mixed stand for instance, 100-hr fuels jumped to 10 Mg ha-1 immediately following a thinning treatment.\nOur average 1,000-hr fuel loading of 42 Mg ha-1 was somewhat lower than found in old growth stands (63 Mg ha-1) and the very young, mixed stands (54 Mg ha-1). These estimates are accompanied by relatively high standard errors, but it would not be surprising that State Park forests, with little to no recent harvest activity would have a larger amount of large downed logs then an actively managed forest such as ours.\nThe similarity in average fuel loading between our Pre-PCT stands and two studies conducted in structurally distinct redwood forests aligns with our finding of few statistically significant differences in fuel loading among treatments. This result is common among other studies and is expected due to the highly variable nature of forest fuels (Collins et al., 2016; Keane et al., 2001, 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nTODO: discuss observed anomalies with HA treatment in general\nIn all cases the largest observed differences involved the HA treatment. For instance, for Duff & Litter was lowest in the HA treatment and highest in the HD treatment (p = 0.10) and this trend was paralleled by a similar trend in vegetation fuel loading as well as in tanoak basal area.\nVegetation fuel loading was lowest in the HA treatment and the greatest difference was between the GS and HA treatments. Lower vegetation fuel loading in the HA treatment is reflected in the tanoak basal area results for the HA treatment, which were collected separately\n\n\nIn a study across California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, fine fuel loading (including 1-, 10-, and 100-hr fuels) were found to be correlated with overstory canopy cover and proportion of shade tolerant species and associated these conditions, which represent recent shifts in forest composition resulting from fire suppression, with an elevated risk of high severity fire (Collins et al., 2016). The differences we observed in duff & litter, and 1-hr fuel loads could be a result of canopy cover and understory species composition directly, but it is likely also a result of the microclimatic differences resulting from these different stand structures. Fine fuel loads are a function of both recruitment and decomposition and the latter is a function of moisture and temperature (Keane, 2008; Pillers & Stuart, 1993). Forest floor conditions in the HA treatment may have been somewhat more moist than the more open treatments due to sheltering but warmer than the HD treatment due to greater light infiltration (e.g., Kane (2021)). While the differences in duff & litter loading we observed are not likely to have a significant impact on fire behavior, small differences in forest floor moisture can have significant implications for prescribed burning operations.\nFor both 1-hr and vegetation fuel loading, the HA treatment was most similar to the HD treatment. In both treatments it appears that a greater density of overstory trees would result in more twigs and less light available for growth of vegetation at the surface. The high density treatments had less tanoak BA and it is likely that tanoak was largely responsible for the vegetative fuel loading differences. Vegetation fuel loading was not recorded by species but redwood and tanoak sprouts comprised the vast majority of vegetation fuels.\nOur understanding of the conditions under which crown fires initiate and spread are not well understood for several reasons and largely because of the difficulty in observing and studying large fires (Finney et al., 2021; Xanthopoulos & Athanasiou, 2020). Less still is known about crown fire behavior in this unique and transitional fuel type (mixed conifer/tanoak sprouts). Because of the relatively low bulk density of canopy fuels, smaller differences in fuel load equate to larger differences in total fuel volume and resulting fire behavior, as well as implications for aerial fuel continuity. These factors warrant more study into the fire behavior of this unique fuel type, including its requirements for combustion, fuel moisture, and more precise characterization of it’s mass and bulk density.\nIt was surprising that the modeled vegetation fuel loading differences were not more clearly differentiated because our field crew’s experience was that the GS and LD treatments were usually much more difficult to work in and travel through due to greater understory density.\nIn this study, live and dead vegetation components were combined because the focus was on total fuel load rather than fuel moisture content. This choice allowed for a clearer representation of the overall quantity of combustible material. Additionally, herbaceous fuel loading was generally very low, which supported the decision to merge herbaceous and woody loads at the transect level. By simplifying in this way, the analysis emphasized patterns of total vegetation loading while limiting unnecessary complexity in the analysis.\n\n\n4.3.2 Post-PCT\nDuff and litter are not reported for post-pct stands for two reasons. First, these are not expected to have changed significantly given the relatively short timespan before and after PCT. Second, our sampling protocol did not make it clear how to quantify the loading for leaves attached to recently cut branches, especially given that these “suspended litter” particles were in a state of active transition to the ground, as they dry, abscise, and sift through the coarser woody fuels as they make their way to the ground. This class may deserve more attention because of it’s potentially dynamic relationship with the timing of prescribed fires: as suspended particles settle and begin to decompose they’re bulk density changes and bulk density is an important determinant of fire behavior.\nVegetative growth following thinning and harvest is an important consideration for fire informed management. In our experiment, greater overstory retention resulted in lower understory size and density. Therefore, 10 years of growth (followed by PCT) led to some increase in average fine woody fuel loading, particularly in the dense understories of the GS and LD treatments. One-hr fuels increased most in the GS and LD treatments but there was also an unexpected increase in 1-hr fuels in the HD treatment compared to the HA treatment which had a negligible increase. Ten-hr fuels increased most in the GS and somewhat in the LD treatment, reflecting the more rapid growth seen in these treatments compared to the others.\nPre-commercial thinning resulted in little change in 1,000-hr fuels, as thinned sapling stems were mostly under three inches, although a potential increase observed in the HD treatment may have been a result of some previously retained canopy trees being cut (12 inches DBH was the prescribed upper limit for thinning). The model selection process resulted in slightly different models after pre-commercial thinning, compared to before thinning for a given fuel class. The model selection process was guided by balancing parsimony, AIC, and the production of well distributed residuals. As predicted fuel load variability increased along with predicted fuel loads following PCT, model selection tended towards more complex models that accounted for this variability–particularly for 1- and 100-hr fuels.\nIt can be seen from this analysis, resulting surface fuel conditions are expected to be the result of a complex interaction of understory stand productivity, overstory retention, and decomposition rate. Whether any of the differences we observed result in a significant difference in prescribed or wild fire will need to be tested by those disturbances. It is possible that the elevated 10-hr loads in the GS and to a lesser degree, the LD treatments may represent greater fuel continuity which could support prescribed fire operations. Likewise, the HA treatment’s lower fuel loading across classes could signify patchy fuel distribution.",
