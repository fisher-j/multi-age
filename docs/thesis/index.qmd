## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This is an analysis of the 10-year re-measure of the Redwood multi-age
experiment. It was started by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture at
Cal-Poly Humboldt. The experiment is located in the Jackson Demonstration State
Forest in Mendocino County, California. The multi-age experiment explores the
regeneration response of several species following different harvesting
techniques including group selection, aggregated retention, and high/low
dispersed retention. The 10-year re-measure data includes surface fuel
characterization.
