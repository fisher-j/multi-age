    "text": "Abstract\nThis is an analysis of the 10-year re-measure of the Redwood multi-age experiment. It was started by Dr. Pascal Berrill, professor of silviculture at Cal-Poly Humboldt. The experiment is located in the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in Mendocino County, California. The multi-age experiment explores the regeneration response of several species following different harvesting techniques including group selection, aggregated retention, and high/low dispersed retention. The 10-year re-measure data includes surface fuel characterization.",
