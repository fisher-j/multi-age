<p>Our sampling included relatively few minor species and differences across treatments were small. The only statistically detectable difference was with the HA treatment which resulted in less minor species. While this could be due to low numbers and high variability within treatments, this phenomena is corroborated by the low vegetation response found in the HA treatment for the separately gathered fuels data (<a href="results.html#fig-fuel-pre-pct" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.7</span></a>), as well as for tanoak sprout basal area where the only statisticaly supported evidence of treatment difference was between the GS and HA treatments.</p>

<p>Fuel loading found in our treatments were comparable to those found in other studies in redwood systems. Our treatment level averages for duff and litter ranged from 40 to 55 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in plots that had post-harvest basal areas (in 2012) of 0 to 40 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>. This was comparable to total duff and litter loading found in 120-year-old redwood stands (range: 29 to 55 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) as well as old-growth stands (averge: 50 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and our raw average duff and litter depth of 6.2 cm (data not shown) was similar to that found in a &lt;30-year-old mixed Douglas-fir/redwood stand <span class="citation" data-cites="finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993 stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985 glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015">(<a href="#ref-finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993" role="doc-biblioref">Finney &amp; Martin, 1993a</a>; <a href="#ref-glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015" role="doc-biblioref">Glebocki, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985" role="doc-biblioref">Stuart, 1985</a>)</span>. We opted to combine duff and litter into a single metric following previous studies that found similar bulk densities for duff and litter and that separating the two resulted in little difference from and average bulk density, given the wide variability found in duff and litter depths<span class="citation" data-cites="stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985">Finney &amp; Martin (<a href="#ref-finneyFuelLoadingBulk1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Our average total fine woody fuel loading, including one-, ten-, and one hundred-hour-fuels (15 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was within the range found in 120-year-old stands (9 to 20 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="citation" data-cites="finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993">Finney &amp; Martin (<a href="#ref-finneyModelingEffectsPrescribed1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993b</a>)</span>), double that found in very young, mixed stands <span class="citation" data-cites="glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015">(<a href="#ref-glebockiFuelLoadingMoisture2015" role="doc-biblioref">Glebocki, 2015</a>)</span>, and 4 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> higher than that found in old growth stands <span class="citation" data-cites="stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985">(<a href="#ref-stuartRedwoodFireEcology1985" role="doc-biblioref">Stuart, 1985</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following I’ll compare the average fuel loadings found in this study to those found in the “old growth” and “very young, mixed” stands referenced above.</p>
<p>Our one-hr fuel loading which, which averaged about 1 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> was similar to that found in the old-growth stand, but about half that found in the very young, mixed stand.</p>
<p>Our average 10-hr fuel loading was higher than in the very young, mixed stand (3.4 vs.&nbsp;2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) but similar to the old growth stand.</p>
<p>Our average 100-hr fuel loading of about 11 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> was higher than in both the old growth stands (5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and the very young, mixed stands (3 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>).</p>
<p>Our average 1,000-hr fuel loading of 42 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> was somewhat lower than found in old growth stands (63 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) as well as in the very young, mixed stands (54 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>). These estimates are accompanied by relatively high standard errors, but it would not be surprising that State Park forest, with little to no harvest activity would have a larger amount of large downed logs then an actively managed forest such as ours.</p>
<p>Our elevated average 100-hr fuel loading may be the result of residual fuels left over from the harvest treatment that initiated our experiment which would have been absent from the other sites referenced here. In the very young, mixed stand, 100-hr fuels jumped to 10 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> immediately following a thinning treatment. For our 10-hr fuels, it might be reasonable to suspect that the smaller trees in the very young, mixed stand did not supply as much 10-hr fuels because of the sizes of their branches, whereas branch shedding patterns in the 10-hr time lags class were more similar between our stands and the old growth ones. Our reduced 1-hr fuel loading compared to the very young, mixed forest could be due to differing stand structures and species compositions. That forest was composed of a large proportion very young Douglas-fir and would be expected to have different forest floor characteristics and this notion is supported by our finding of similar 1-hr fuel loading as in the old growth study. Another source of possible error is differences in sampling method for 1-hr fuels. We established a cutoff where redwood particles smaller than roughly 2 mm were considered as litter, rather than 1-hr fuels. If we had counted every redwood leaf-spray, regardless of size, we would have likely found higher 1-hr fuel loads.</p>
<p>That we found similar average fuel loading in our Pre-PCT stands compared to two studies in very different redwood forest structures is congruent with our findings of few statistically significant differences between treatments in terms of fuel loading. This result is common among other studies and is expected due to the highly variable nature of forest fuels (CITATIONS). Statistical difference at the p &lt; 0.05 level were only found among treatments for 1-hr and Vegetation loading, and nearly found for Duff &amp; Litter. In all cases these differences involved the HA treatment, but the nature of the comparisons varied with fuel types. For instance, for Duff &amp; Litter was lowest in the HA treatment and highest in the HD treatment (p = 0.07). This potential difference in fuel load could be indicative of differences in fuel moisture because forest floor decomposition is a function of both moisture and temperature (CITATIONS). Forest floor conditions in the HA treatment would be expected to be somewhat more moist than the more open treatments, but potentially also warmer (due to greater light infiltration) than the HD treatment. Small differences in forest floor moisture can have significant implications for prescribed burning operations because these are often conducted under marginal conditions (CITATIONS). In terms of both 1-hr fuel loading and Vegetation fuel loading, the HA treatment was most similar to the HD treatment. In these cases it is not surprising that a greater density of sizeable trees would result in more twigs and less light available for growth of vegetation at the surface. It is somewhat surprising that the HA treatment did not reveal measurable differences in understory growth. This result does not support our previous supposition in regards to Duff &amp; Litter loading, of differences in understory light (temperature) between the HD and HA treatments. But it could be that understory growth dynamics are more complicated than simple light availability and to this end, other researchers have proposed exploring the potential effects of below-ground competition (CITATIONS). It was also somewhat surprising that the modeled Vegetation fuel loading differences were not more pronounced because, while conducting field work, GS and LD treatments were usually much more difficult to work in due to the amount of understory growth present in these treatments. And these conditions were also indicated by our findings of somewhat elevated basal area of tanoak and redwood in those treatments. Our method of calculating vegetation fuel loading (estimated percent cover times estimated height within an estimated cylinder) might have been overly imprecise. Additionally, given the importance of understory light to the processes of surface fuel decomposition as well as for understory growth, inclusion of the potentially confounding variable: aspect might have led to better explanatory power in our models. Our plots were established over a range of aspects, but it is plausible that differences in aspect outweighed differences between treatments. We had hoped that the inclusion of site and treatment as nested random effects would have captured site and block level differences in aspect. Additionally, aspect is largely a proxy for insolation, and this may have also varied with shade conditions (very large trees or roadcuts) outside of the plot.</p>

<section id="post-pct" class="level3" data-number="4.3.2">
<h3 data-number="4.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="post-pct"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Post-PCT</h3>
<p>Duff and litter are not reported for post-pct stands for two reasons. First, these are not expected to have changed significantly given the relatively short timespan before and after PCT. Second, our sampling protocol did not make it clear how to quantify the loading for leaves attached to recently cut branches, especially given that these “suspended litter” particles were in a state of active transition to the ground, as they dry, abscise, and sift through the coarser woody fuels as they make their way to the ground. This class may deserve more attention because of it’s potentially dynamic relationship with the timing of prescribed fires: as suspeded particles settle and begin to decompose they’re bulk density changes and bulk density is an important determinant of fire behavior.</p>
<p>Crews were guided to thin to achieve the same understory conditions across all four treatments and this is indicated by similar post-PCT vegetation fuel loads (<a href="results.html#fig-fuel-post-pct" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.8</span></a>). Fuel differences resulting from PCT were driven by fuels in the vegetation fuels class, i.e., growth and productivity. Vegetative growth following thinning and harvest is an important consideration for fire informed management. In our experiment, 10 years of growhth (followed by PCT) led to some increase in average 100-hr fuel loading but only for the GS treatment. Ten-hr fuels increased in the GS and LD treatments aparently as a function reducing competition in these treatments (<a href="results.html#fig-fuel-pct-comparison" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.9</span></a>). One-hr fuels increased most, in the GS and LD treatments, but also started out somewhat lower 1-hr fuel loading than the HA and HD treatments, which resulted in the the post-pct fuel loading being simliar, except for in the HA treatment, where unexpectedly low vegetative fuel loading resulted in little to no increase in 1-hr fuels after PCT, likely because much of the existing vegetation (saplings) needed to be retained to meet the presctiption (<a href="results.html#fig-fuel-pct-comparison" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.9</span></a>). Pre-commercial thinning resulted in little change in 1,000-hr fuels, as thinned sapling stems were mostly under three inches, although a potential increase observed in the HD treatment may have been a result of some previosly retained canopy trees being cut (12 inches dbh was the prescribed upper limit for thinning). The model selection process resulted in slightly different models after pre-commercial thinning, compared to before thinning for a given fuel class. These changes may be somewhat arbitrary, as the model selection process was guided by balancing parsimony, AIC, and the production of well distributed residuals. In a few cases, the higher values associated with post-PCT fuel loading predictions tended towards models that accounted for greater (variation in) variability.</p>
<p>The simple method we used probably over-estimated vegetation fuel loading, evidenced by the fact that the large fuel loading differences observed in the vegetation class are not reflected in the increase in fine fuels. Although the contribution of slash foliage is not accounted for, it appears our method may have overpredicted vegetation loading by around a factor of three if we assume that the majority of the difference in vegetation fuels should be captured by the sum of the changes in fine fuels and the decrease in 100-hr fuels after PCT is assumed to be the result of sampling error.</p>
<p>It can be seen from this analysis resulting surfaces fuel conditions are expected to be the result of a complex interaction of productivity and decomposition rate. Whether any of the differences we observed result in a significant difference in prescribed or wild fire will need to be tested by those disturbances. It is possible that the elevated 10-hr loads in the GS and to a lesser degree, the LD treatments may represent greater fuel continuity which could support prescribed fire operations. Likewise, the HA treatment’s lower fuel loading across classes could signify patchy fuel distribution. Surface fuel moisture and windspeed are two variables which we did not study but which have a strong influence on fire behavior and are also affected by overstory density and arrangement. Given the relatively modest differnence we observed in fuel loads, it seems likely that those unmeasured factors could have a greater bearing on fire outcomes.</p>
